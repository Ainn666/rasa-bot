THE . PRICE KUCHING, Wednesday, July 1st, 1936. 20 CENTS. The . WEDNESDAY, JULY 1st. 1936. Local and Personal. JUNE. His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie arrived in London on Saturday after¬ noon, June the 15th. Before leaving for England, His Highness the Rajah very kindly announced that members of the public are welcome to visit Bedil House gardens on any day of the week between the hours of four and six p.m. These gardens are really delightful, and are well worth a visit. We hear that Mr. E. O. Bruce, Sarawak Civil Service, who is at present at home on leave, is shortly to be married. Mr. Bruce, who has been granted one month’s extension of furlough, is due to arrive in Singapore on August 8th, and we understand that on his return to Sarawak he will relieve Mr. W. S. B. Buck as District Officer, Miri. Mr. and Mrs. Buck sail from Singapore on home leave on August 14th. Mr. Bruce’s appointment at Miri will be of a temporary nature only, since he will take over from Mr. H. E. Cutfield as District Officer, Limbang and Lawas, when Mr. Cut¬ field assumes the acting Residency of the Second Division in September. Mr. L. N. Reynolds, Commissioner of Sara¬ wak Constabulary, left Kuching on furlough on June 22nd. Mr. Reynolds intends to travel to England, via Africa, and we wish him a pleasant trip and an enjoyable leave. On the 20th a most successful farewell dinner was given in Mr. Reynolds’ honour at the Rest House, Kuching. A large number of Europeans attended, and music was pro¬ vided by the Kuching Military Band. Mr. D. V. Murphy will act as Com¬ missioner during Mr. Reynolds' absence. The wireless station at Nanga Meluan, the new Government station in the Ulu Kanowit, was opened on the 8th, Mr. F. Harding of the Posts and Telegraphs Department having visited Meluan for that purpose. His High- ness the Tuan Muda despatched the following message to Mr. A. Macpherson, District Officer, in order to mark the occasion “The linking up of Nanga Meluan with so called civilisation by means of wireless affords me an opportunity of sending all good wishes to yourself and the new station and of expressing my confidence in Meluan's future.” Mr. F. S. Gibson. Managing Director of Messrs, the Straits Steamship Co., paid a short visit to Kuching early in the month, arriving on June 1st and leaving on the 13th. On June 25th a telegram was received to say that a Chinese trader and his wife had been murdered in the Ulu Spak, Saribas dis¬ trict. The heads of the murdered couple were not taken, and the motive for the crime was apparently robbery. No details have yet reached Kuching. We welcome back Mr. N. A. Middlemas, Superintendent of Lands aud Surveys, who returned from furlough on June 22nd We understand that Mrs. Middlemas expects to arrive in Kuching in August. Mr. R. E. Le Sueur returned from on valescent leave by the Vyner Brooke on June 19th, and proceeded to Sibu a few days later. Mr. H. M. Calvert, who left for Singapore for medical treatment on the 6th. returned on the 22nd. We publish in this issue a most interesting article on the Kelabit country by Mr. E. Banks, Curator, Sarawak Museum, who recently returned from a protracted visit to that area. Mr. Banks has finally solved the riddle of the stone “monuments’’ discovered by the late Captain Andreini some years ago, and has proved conclusively that they are not relics of a vanished civilization, but the work of living Kelabits. The first telephone conversation between Kuching and Serian was held on June 19th. The line is extraordinarily clear, and reflects great credit on the Posts and Telegraphs Department. People speaking from Serian, which is a good forty miles away, sound just as though they were in the next bungalow. We welcome to Sarawak the Rev. Father A. H. Blair, C.R., who arrived in Kuching on June 22nd to join the Fathers of the Community of the Resurrection. Mr. R W. Hammond arrived in Kuching on June 29th on a visit to his son, Mr. I. S. Hammond of the Land and Survey Depart¬ ment. He left a few days later for Mukah. where Mr. Hammond is at present stationed. Economic and Social Development in the Colonies. W. H. McLean,Ph.D. (Glas.), M.Inst.C.E. INTRODUCTORY. Recent trends and tendencies in colonial develop¬ ment. mainly the result of changes in world economic and social conditions, deserve close study aud research. With regard to economic matters there was not the same need for close study in the. days of expanding markets. The economic condi¬ tions which now exist, and seem likely to continue, have called for some government action in trade matters in all countries including the colonies. Such action is taken to improve the trade position and it entails it continuous review of the economic, situation to note what is happening and make necessary adjustments as conditions change. As the social betterment of a colony must depend, to a large extent, upon its economic development, it is essential that the progress of both should be co-ordinated. It is obvious that the more or less haphazard development, which often took place in the days of expanding markets, could not be allowed to continue under present world conditions without risk of economic disaster and consequent social distress. It is therefore desirable to determine what underlying general principles should be observed in guiding or carrying out economic and social develop¬ ment either by government or by private enterprise in any territory. For example, the simple formula that development depends upon "men, money and markets" seems obvious, but many disasters have occurred through neglect of one of the. factors ; while the same may be said regarding neglect of the now accepted principle that education should be related to the economic and social needs of a territory. This article reviews economic and social develop¬ ment in its main aspects or departments, that is Trade, Education, Public Health, Agriculture. Labour, and Communication. The need for their co-ordination is shown, while reference is made to the underlying principles which should be remem- bered in considering development both locally and at the centre. The need for co-operation becomes evident when we consider the relation of depart¬ ments to each other, and to the trade and economic situation. A great deal of this co-operative work is already being done in certain Colonies. Encourage- inent and assistance to government and private enterprise in the Colonies is given in this direction by the Colonial Office which is responsible for general guidance in questions of principle, policy, and economic background in development. TRADE. It is now realised that development must be based upon sound economic foundation of trade, and that with the means thus provided the programme of social betterment can be earned out. It is only by the expansion of trade that a colony can provide the means for raising the standard of life, which, so far as possible, must be protected against the violent fluctuations and consequent distress of past ex¬ perience. Until recently the existence of the Colonial Em¬ pire as an economic entity was barely recognised. There was no common economic and commercial policy and no machinery for putting it into effect. The economic problem of the Colonies during recent years has been, and is to-day, a problem of finding markets. Owing to absence in the past of assured markets and of sufficient economic ‘information, development was necessarily haphazard, and it often proved to be uneconomic, because, under the conditions which existed, there could be no co¬ ordination of production throughout the Colonial Empire. Without such information it is impossible to encourage colonial producers to grow what would profit them most or, on the other hand, tn dissuade them from growing commodities which could not be profitable. In order to be in a position to give advice and guidance in these matters the Colonial Office has prepared the necessary information and taken the appropriate measures. A comprehensive economic survey has been prepared and published under the title of “An Economic Survey of the Colonial Empire.’’ and it will be revised and issued by the Colonial Office annually. It gives a complete review of the resources of every Colony, Pro¬ tectorate. and Mandated Territory, its financial position, and its actual trade, import, and export, and the markets of both, as well as the expenditure on each of the public services stated as a proportion of the total expenditure. A comprehensive survey of shipping services throughout the British Empire was also undertaken. The information contained in these surveys has been of great utility in connec¬ tion with the arrangements for securing markets for Colonial produce. Markets have been as far as possible assured throughout the British Empire largely by the system of tariff preferences, and also in certain foreign countries by tariff reductions, the allocation of quotas and other measures. The arrangements with foreign countries are contained in the Trade Agreements with the United Kingdom ; an interesting example is Poland where the usual “two-way” trade, so popular in most countries, is definitely converted to “triangular” trade, the United Kingdom's adverse balance of trade with Poland being put against concession by Poland to British Colonial produce. This is a valuable con¬ cession and a trade principle useful to the Colonies when circumstances permit of its application. The Colonies having now obtained an assured footing in Empire markets and in certain foreign countries, colonial production can be directed to take the fullest advantage of all the openings thus secured. There are also the international schemes which regulate the production of colonial commodities where, for the time being, production greatly exceeds consumption. The schemes of this kind now in operation for tea. rubber, and tin have materially improved the financial position of the territories concerned. The foregoing refers to the measures taken to expand the external or export market of the Colonies. Expansion of the internal market follows from the resulting increased purchasing power and rise in the standard of living of the natives This expansion of the internal market includes foodstuffs produced locally. In this connection the study of nutrition may yield information as to lines of foodstuffs the production of which might be encouraged by educative measures. Economic progress on these lines depends upon co-operation with the medical and educational authorities. The suggestion that the Colonies should actively promote industrialisation, as an aid to economic progress, requires special consideration because it has serious limitations. It is obvious that manu¬ facturing countries like this and many others could not afford to provide unlimited free or assured markets for manufactured goods in direct competi¬ tion with their own. All questions of starting new industries in the Colonies must therefore be examined on their merits and with due regard to the welfare of the Colony as a whole and as a primary producer. It should be remembered that industrial development may change rapidly the entire economic life of a more or less primitive and agricultural people, and, to undertake it on insecure markets might result in disaster and suffering. Further, a secure economic foundation cannot be neglected by the authorities because industrialisation may entail changes in population distribution as well ad the provision of communications and public and social services. Education, for example, must be adapted to it. It should not be forgotten that agricultural populations are better able tn meet financial crises as they can turn from cash crop production to foodstuffs. EDUCATION. Steady progress throughout the Colonies has been made in recent years, not only in elementary education but also in secondary, vocational, and technical education. The Advisory Committee on Education in the Colonies has recently produced two valuable reports, one on the education of African communities and the other on the Higher Educa¬ tion of Natives in Africa. Briefly, the aim is to train the native to become a useful citizen and to take his part in the economic and social progress of his country. Recent developments recognise the need for co-ordination in all the agencies aiming at social and economic improvement. It is also recognised that the nature of the education and the numbers trained should be related to the economic and social needs of the territory. It would be a mistake, for example, to flood an agricultural country with clerks or carpenters; yet there are examples of this. The “Memorandum on the Education of African Communities"'issued by the Colonial Office in 1935, states that the true educational aim “involves a clear recognition of the intimate connection between the educational policy and the economic policy, and demands a close collaboration between the different agencies responsible for public health, agriculture, and schools." Reports show that in many colonies an encouraging co-ordination in the work of these services is already taking place, and that the economic aspect is not being neglected. The intimate connection referred to is also found to exist in the work of the Advisory Committee on Educa¬ tion which is frequently called upon to examine questions of educational development including agricultural and medical education, as well as to consider the demands of economic development. The Memorandum referred to points out that there is need for the promotion of adult education if a pro¬ gramme of social betterment is to be fully realised. This adult education would he related to the agricultural; technical, and medical school activities and would include the improvement of agriculture by farm demonstrations, assistance in the marketing of crops, the building of better houses, the improve¬ ment of sanitary arrangements, water supply, drainage and other health measures. The Annual Reports of some Colonies show that already a certain amount of co-operative work is being done along these lines. In dealing with the broad educational objective the Memorandum referred to states that “a programme of general social advancement will progressively require for its execution a steadily increasing number of well-trained African doctors, agriculturists. veterinarians, engineers, teachers, and research workers.” PUBLIC HEALTH. With regard to public health there has also been great progress in recent years. On the principle that “prevention is better than cure,” the modern practice is to concentrate on preventive measures, and it has been found that this can best be done by co-operation with other departments. Much attention is being given to the prevention of disease by improving sanitary conditions and by anti¬ malaria and other measures. It is agreed that unsatisfactory health conditions are one of the main factors which have retarded the advancement of some of the Colonial peoples in the past. The Memorandum on community education, already referred to, states that the school “can give instruc¬ tion in practical hygiene, inculcate sound habits of health, and explain the need and methods of im¬ proved sanitation .... Health propaganda among the young will be to a large extent wasted effort unless it is linked up with a campaign con¬ ducted by the Medical Department among the adult members of the community............................ ” Public health is closely linked with economic d velopment and it is safe to say that some, areas could not be developed without first undertaking public health measures. Again, economic develop¬ ment involving, perhaps, land drainage for agricul¬ tural purposes, may also be the only method of improving the health conditions of the area and clearing it of, say, malaria. The opening of the air line between the Sudan and Nigeria was only possible after steps had been taken to clear by drainage the aerodromes and the land in their immediate vicinity of the mosquitoes which might communicate yellow fever. Particular attention is now being given by the medical authorities to preventing the transfer of malaria, dengue, and yellow fever by mosquitoes in aeroplanes. Reports from the Colonies show that the close connection between public health, education, and economic development is becoming recognised, and that as economic development raises the standard of native life so the public health improves. Attempts are being made to co-ordinate progress in all the departments so that the work of each would follow a programme lending towards the same objective, namely, the general advancement of economic and social conditions. With reference to nutrition and increased consumption of foodstuffs leading to an expansion of production in a Colony, it was noted under the heading of “Trade’’ that economic progress on these lines depends upon co-operation with the medical and educational authorities. AGRICULTURE. Economic development in the Colonial Empire is largely agricultural. A necessary counterpart of the measures to obtain or retain markets has been to ensure efficient production and marketing of the Colonial products. There is hardly a commodity in which some efforts in this direction have not been made. In the case of hardwoods, it was arranged that selected Forest Officers from each Colony con¬ cerned should be sent here to study the requirements of the markets and to become acquainted with the research work being done on the qualities of Colonial timbers. In the West Indies co-operation has been obtained in their shipments of vegetables to the Canadian market. The marketing of bananas is now being considered. The clove industry, upon which Zanzibar is entirely dependent, has been organised and a stable price maintained. The assured market for grapefruit has been followed by an improvement in the types grown and improved grading and packing. These are a few examples of what has been done. Apart from the development of entirely new commodities, the securing of markets has encouraged the development of alternative products in Colonies hitherto dependent on one or two basic crops, the failure of which might be dis¬ astrous. For example, experiments are being made for the growing of bananas and citrus in West Africa. The Economic Survey, referred to, shows that in a number of instances Colonies were importing food supplies which they were capable of producing or supplementing themselves. In so far as Colonies can produce food instead of importing it, they improve their balance of trade. Encouragement in this direction has been given to producers and already the growth of commodities like rice and cassava is being undertaken or increased. Under the beading of “Public Health,” and with reference to nutrition, the possibility of increasing production and consumption of foodstuffs was noted. The Memorandum on community education, already referred to, states that the school activities “need to be correlated with the efforts of the agricultural department to improve the economic life of the community.“ There is evidence that co-ordination along these lines is already being done in some Colonies. LABOUR. It is necessary to consider the local labour question especially in economic development schemes which entail large works like irrigation; it may be a factor which determines the programme and even the practicability of the schemes. It is desirable to know, not only the numbers available, but also the suitability and adaptability of the labourer and the possibility of migration, as well as to take account of the social aspect of the question. It is of interest to note the report that in some Colonies the recent slump forced plantation workers to take up food crop cultivation, and that they are now expanding economic crop cutivation on their own account which they can often do at less cost than the plantation. The question of labour conditions is one which receives due consideration in the Colonies it is satisfactory to record. COMMUNICATIONS. The question of transport is usually important in any scheme of economic development. The pro¬ ducer must be able to transport his economic or cash crop at a cost which will enable him to compete in his market. The nature and the amount of the traffic must be estimated, and this, along with the length of haul, will determine the type of transport which would be most economic. Carriage by water being the cheapest form of transport the aim should be to get the produce to the sea by the most direct route. For long hauls the railway and for short hauls the motor vehicle is usually the most economic form of transport. The roads should be constructed as nearly as possible at right angles to the railway so as to act as feeders to it, and not parallel with the railway and thus in direct competition with it. This principle has sometimes been overlooked with unfortunate results. Under certain conditions the use of the "roadless” type of motor vehicle may be economic. The development of ports requires a comprehensive study of possibilities of the import and export trades as well as the economics of ship¬ ping and the proximity effect of other ports. It is well to remember that the layout of the transport system may determine new town and village locations, and this entails public, health questions such as suitability of the site and of the water supply. The well-being of the inhabitants may depend upon the proper location of these things. Recent developments in transport by air have also shown the need for co-operation with the public health authorities to prevent the spread of disease- Reference to this has been made under the heading of "Public Health." CO-ORDINATION OF DEVELOPMENT. From the foregoing the intimate relation between departments is clearly seen. It has been shown that economic development, that is to say produc¬ tion should be related to the markets available. It is also evident that social betterment must be related to economic development. This means co¬ ordination in all these matters. It is of interest to note that the Economic Survey, referred to, provides information which will assist Colonial Administra¬ tions to prepare or revise programmes of general development co-ordinating all department work in a Colony. Reports show that plans and programmes of this nature exist in some Colonies. The need for them has been recognised: for example, the Report of the Kenya Expenditure Advisory Committee, 1933, contains the following recom¬ mendation : "We have been struck by the absence of any province-wide or colony-wide plan of develop¬ ment activities embracing all departments. This we regard as a serious deterrent to organised progress which should be remedied at the earliest possible date.” • With regard to machinery for the preparation and execution of such programmes the Memorandum on community education, already referred to, makes the following statement regarding social betterment programmes which is equally applicable to those of economic development : "If a co-ordinated pro¬ gramme of social betterment is to be successfully , planned and executed, some new type of organisation seems to be called for. Whether the ends in view can be achieved by conferences of the heads of technical departments at the centre, or by provincial conferences of technical officers, or by the establish¬ ment of some form of rural community council on which the voluntary agencies could be re¬ presented, or by some combination, modification, or development of these methods, is a matter for the Government for the various territories to determine.” From the departmental schemes or plans of economic and social development (education, public health, agriculture, and public works) the pro¬ grammes for a few years ahead can be prepared and related to each other and to the economic situation, that is to the possibilities of trade development in the Colony and the consequent financial position. The information so provided would be useful in framing estimates. In this way a balanced pro¬ gramme of development can be pursued ; there is less risk of economic disaster to the population and also less risk of development being pushed too far ahead of possible markets as has sometimes occurred in the past. There are throughout the Empire, examples of railways, harbours, irrigation and other works which have never justified their existence, their construction was undertaken on insufficient information regarding the economic background. Similarly, educational and public health schemes have sometimes been prepared which had no relation to the economic situation and to the needs of the country. There are cases where educational develop¬ ment not so related has necessitated modification of the original aim in order to avoid further waste. A balanced programme of development in a territory is necessary to avoid, for example, too much being spent in one direction while other essential work is starved. An unbalanced development generally results in waste. The Report (1934) on the financial and economic position of British Honduras disclosed an example of development based upon an inadequate economic foundation. The Report states that there has been "failure to plan ahead” and that the policy of development work "has resembled a succession of impulsed inadequately thought out.” It must be clearly understood that the development programmes cannot be rigidly adhered to. They must be elastic and subject to annual or frequent revision as well as to the modifications necessitated by changed conditions and by the financial situation. Their general aim is to ensure that balanced economic and social development which is essential to progress, and to assist the authorities in giving the guidance in development required by producers and others in the Colonies.—Reprinted from "journal of the Royal African Society," April, 1936. The Kelabit Country. AN ACCOUNT OF A RECENT VISIT. The Kelabit country, situated in the headwaters of the Baram River, is reputed to bo a fabulous place where food and drink flow in abundance, where rice, potatoes and vegetables grow in profusion, where buffaloes, cows and goats thrive, and where a delectable kind of salt is prepared. In addition to all this, the whole country is situated between three and four thousand feet above sea level, and is said to enjoy an almost European climate. One can reach this paradise by several different routes, but each of them involves a climb of 5,000 feet or more over the Tama Abo mountains, and for this reason its products are not widely known, and its confines are not often visited. From Baram station a boat journey of at least eight days—longer, if the river is in flood,—brings one to a fort at Lio Matu, beyond which the river enters into deep gorges and becomes impassable for boats, and one has to take to one's own flat feet. Of the two available routes, the one taken on this occasion was up the Selungau river, a tributary of the Baram, over the hills to avoid crossing the headwaters of the Selungau about twenty-six times, and then down into a Kelabit house at Long Lelang. which can also be reached by going up the Akah river, another tributary of the Baram notorious for its rapids. The watershed between the Selungau and Akah is a spur of the Tama Abo mountains, here only 1,500 feet high but soon rising again to some 5,000 feet at Mt. Murud Kechil. From Long Lelang a day's walk brings one to Ansalam. crossing again a watershed between the Akah and Tutoh, another tributary of the Baram river likewise notorious for the rapids in its middle reaches. Down the Tutoh and over another watershed nearly 4.000 feet high takes one into the Keba'an, a tributary of the Tutoh here unnavigable. but with several Kelabit houses separated by the inevitable couple of thousand feet of bill Finally one leaves the Keba'an river to aseend Pungga Pawan, part of the Tama Abo mountains some 5,000 feet high, and from which one can see the true Kelabit country stretching away below. There follows a descent into the first house at Dalam Bah, an interesting spot where the Kclabits have taken to irrigating their padi, which grows in profusion: this season they had so much they had not vet finished reaping, whilst the people in the mid-Baram had finished long ago and were preparing to clear their farms for next year’s crop. I have never understood their system of irrigation; their bunds are often three and four feet high, and consist of solid walls designed, I believe, as much to keep the flood water out as to keep in the necessary water for the young padi. The whole system is certainly most ingenious, and one actually sees water being conveyed from level to level, often crossing other streams, in a succession of hollowed- out tree trunks. Though this and some other parts of the Kelabit country are quite flat, it is a popular misconception to believe that the whole of it is so, and that billiard balls can roll about at will, for there followed some distinctly hilly walks to Pa Trap, Pa Mein and Pa Bengar before the flatter country was again touched at Pa Mudok and Pa Mada. At Pa Mein exist the famous salt springs, which are nothing m e nor less than a rather slimy looking pool exuding bubbles of gas. Alongside this pool stands a weird looking factory where I half expected to find a Chinese distilling arak; actually it is used by the Kelabits to boil down the brine for the sake of the salt. They recently had another try at salting down their buffaloes in the hope of being able to sell the meat, but the salt was apparently not salty enough, and the meat- would not keep. The Pa Mudok country was dotted with open gladea and clumps of enormous bamboos, so large, indeed, that they use them for house posts, and the whole made a most agreeable landscape to the European eye. From Pa Mada I followed an old Kelabit trade route across country, over the Tama Abo mountains again and down into the Tutoh and Ansalam. The first part of the journey took me over the usual bills, here about 4,000 feet high, and down into the Libun river, one of the main divisions of the Baram river, which is some 25 yards wide at this point and is a quietly flowing stream with muddy banks, al¬ most like a down-country river. It is possible to reach Pa Trap, Pa Mein and Pa Mudok in boats up and down this river, but the Kelabit, used to walking, is scarcely yet broken to boats, and any¬ way there were none available. The next day's walk was over the flat, across the Pa Biau and for about two hours across a wide quite flat plain, extending for miles up and down river. The soil was very white and sandy, no use to anyone; the vegetation was scrubby and mossy, often consisting of pure stands of selunsor trees, the whole so flat that once cleared and stumped any amount of aeroplanes might land almost without further levelling. Leaving this, I followed the flat valley of the Menaloh for the rest of the day, passing next day over the Tama Abo mountains at a height of 5,000 feet down into the Selunok, a tributary of the Tutoh, and only another half day’s walk from Ansalam. Of the three routes to and from the Kelabit country this is the easiest walking, but it is seldom used because it passes no houses, and three or more nights must be spent in the jungle. The last part of the walk is also famous for its leeches; when stopping every hour or hour and half or so for a smoke, and to give the coolies a chance, I have taken off as many as sixty of these creatures at a time. They are not the ordinary penny-plain leech, but the tuppence-coloured hill variety with all sorts of yellow patterns down the back. They are no respecters of persons, and they fasten on any¬ where from tip to too. Even if they do get away with a cupful of blood, one can still scarcely believe the traveller’s yarn of the “intrepid” explorer fainting from exhaustion and being eaten alive by leeches: I, for one, should die of thirst long before that! The Museum Collectors, whom I had pre¬ viously sent to the mountain, dipped a feather in the arsenical soap used for curing skins and smeared it on their feet and legs; this was apparently too much even for these pests. From Ansalam the same route was followed home but with much trouble at Long Lelang; about a year after a Kelabit dies they collect the bones out of his coffin, bury them in a jar, and celebrate with a “wake.” Long Lelang celebrated a double event on my arrival. The people had killed two buffaloes, many pigs and hens, and prepared thirty-six jars of rice spirit. Now a jar holds anything from three to ten gallons; they put some cooked rice in the bottom, add a few odds and ends to give it a kick, and fill up with water; when that is finished, they fill it up again and yet a third time; so that in view of the fact that they did not number altogether a hundred people, the consumption of food and drink can be imagined. In spite of getting very drunk and all talking at once like a lot of birds in a Kayu Ara tree, there was neither a quarrel nor an accident in the two days’ celebrations, partly due to the Kelabits' inherent good nature, and partly to the large amount of “blotting paper" consumed. The Kelabit is a really hard worker and only goes on the spree more or less occasionally ; as one put it,—"We have no prohibitions, like the down-country fellows, who won’t eat this and that, and refuse deer on Fridays, we are husky fellows, look at our bodies." (They certainly are very well-made and muscular.) Then with a sly grin he said—"We did try eating some centipedes and a scorpion not so long ago, and we were not ourselves for the next seven days. This is I believe to be true, for 1 went to some trouble to verify it. After one night of this party I retired to a hut in the rice fields for peace; the Kelabits lurched along next day with the rest of my goods, whilst we had our revenge fishing the drunks out at the river crossings, now in full Hood. Down the Selungau next day I was led astray into a Kenyah Leppu Nyamok house, where a most cheerful night was spent; these people seemed to be dance mad, and it was no uncommon sight to see the baby torn from the breast whilst the mother went off to dance. From then on the Baram river let us down, and we spent the next seven days watching it flow bank high past Lio Matu Fort, leaving us no chance to get down river through the rapids. I visited the Kelabit country six years ago to see some stone remains that the late Captain Andreini thought to be of Chinese origin, but beyond the fact that they did not seem so to me. I had no real idea what they were. This time the Kelabits camo clean with the whole story; they showed me some stones carved since my last visit, explained some of the old ones, and showed me some more and also their burial grounds, so the trip began to take on rather a funereal aspect. After a great man dies and his bones are put in a jar for burial, there follows a "wake" such as I have described. The Kelabits then select the top of a prominent hill or ridge and cut a large rentis or kawan as a memorial to the dead : this can be seen as a gap in the trees from miles around. They also dig, usually in the middle of the path and on the crest of a hill or mound, a ditch often some ten yards long and three to four feet deep and broad, which they call a nabang. This is a feat of consider¬ able labour. Often in the vicinity of this nabang they erect a pair or two pairs of upright flat-sided stones, protruding five and six feet above the ground ; they do not shape or work these stones in any way, but find them in the river bed—I have seen one ear-marked for the next funeral—and as they weigh a considerable amount it is the labour of many men to cart them up hill on a sort of travois. Further search in the vicinity of the nabang will disclose the jar with the bones of the deceased, but Kelabit aid is sometimes necessary, and they are apt to be a bit reticent about it, especially with strangers. T must have seen scores of these upright stones, some with a large flat stone at the foot, and also quite a number of solitary jars, both old and recent; on two occasions I was shown an actual collection of jars and stones grouped together, so that there is no doubt that the latter are used by Kelabits in connection with burial ceremonies. The jars vary in size' being both medium and large, but the Strangest was a huge block of soft sandstone, shaped like a jar, hollowed out inside for the reception of the bones, and closed on fop and covered with a lid. The whole was embedded in the ground, above which it stood some five feet, and I have seen a similar one. together with upright atones, among the Trusan Muruts, (who are the same people as the Kelabits,) though none of these people would tell me what it was. The Kelabits pointed out that jars, which are now numerous, were once scarce, and therefore they formerly made use of these stone "urns." Similarly there are throughout the Kelabit country a number of crude human carvings, cut on stones, often in relief, and these the people admitted were done by their ancestors. They admitted, also, that a carving re- presenting a woman and a dog near Pa Mein was originally done to commemorate the slaughter of - some innocents close by, and they pointed out that on another stone near Pa Bengar (a carving of a man in relief) the man was wearing the pigskin loin-cloth, formerly a feature of Kelabit apparel, but now displaced by cloth and bark. There is therefore no further doubt that the stone objects in the Kelabit country are of recent and present Kelabit origin, and not Chinese. They are carvings connected with special events, upright stones being associated with burials. Perhaps the main interest is that in the Naga country of Assam some carvings identical in shape with the Kelabit ones occur; there are numerous stone urns for the reception of the bones, some like the Kelabit ones, some different, and finally an even greater profusion of upright stones, many similar to those erected by Kelabits. Many of the similarities between Nagas and Borneans are doubtless due to their living under same climatic and other conditions, which necessitate the same shifts for a living, but by no stretch of the imagination can one apply this theory these stone monuments, and in Sarawak, at any rate, they are to be found mainly among the Kelabits. occasionally among the Muruts. but among no other people.— E. BANKS. Films of the Month. Nou and again—but not very often—a film appears which justifies all the preliminary ballyhoo without which no screen play of any importance car be launched. Such a film was Mutiny an the Bounty. starring Charles Laughton, Clark Gable and Fran¬ chot Tone The previews of this picture contained all the frantic encomiums that we have come to expect. and the usual overwhelming array of facts and figures. As usual, they misfired. We were not in the least interested to learn that Mutiny on the Bounty had cost. $2,000,000: that it had taken two years to make: and that a complete M-G-M production unit bad been sent 14,000 miles to tropic waters in order to shoot the scenes in their actual locale. Nor, to tell the truth, did our pulses race at the announcement that no less than 5,000 natives had appeared in the Tahitian scenes. Hollywood has cried "Masterpiece!" too often; too often has the mountain brought forth a ridiculous mouse. Superlatives are the everyday language of film¬ land’s “barkers." and they have long ceased to thrill us, or even to awaken our interest. But this time they were justified. Mutiny on the Bounty is a superb piece of work, perfectly cast, perfectly acted, and perfectly produced. Moreover, for once Hollywood resisted the temptation to include the normally indispensable love interest. For once the directors were content to rely on the truth,-------- which, in this case, is dramatic enough in all conscience, and the result was worth it a hundred times. Why on earth do they not try this simple expedient more often? The amazing story of the Bounty is too well- known to need repeating here. Suffice to say that the film kept quite astonishingly close to history ; this. in itself, was a most refreshing departure from precedent. Laughton was superb as ‘Bread¬ fruit' Bligh, although in actual fact the latter, of course, was by no means the sadistic brute that Laughton made him out to be. All the same, if Bligh’s character was painted in colours that were rather too dark, let us admit that this heightened the dramatic effect. In spite of this exaggeration, Laughton did triumphantly succeed in giving us a picture of the real Bligh,—the fearless commander and splendid seaman who spoilt everything by tactlessness and excessive severity. But chiefly by tactlessness, for it should be borne in mind that Bligh's trouble came not from his men, but from his officers. If he was a martinet, as he undoubtedly was. it is only fair to remember that so were the great majority of naval commanders in the late eighteenth century for the excellent reason that they had to be; crews composed of gutter-rats from Wapping and the sweepings of the jails could not be controlled by appealing to their better natures. Severity was essential in those days; Bligh's mistake was that his severity was never tempered with good humour and understanding, and so degenerated into intolerable harshness. All the same, history proves that responsibility for the mutiny cannot be assigned wholly to Bligh. Fletcher Christian’s temperament, the abnormal conditions of the Bounty’s cruise, and the beaux yeux of the Tahitian ladies were at least equally guilty. But let us revert to the picture. Laughton, as always, was a joy to watch, and made the most of a part that suited him down to the ground. Clark Gable, too, gave the performance of his career as Fletcher Christian, even though he had to give us a highly idealised version of that moody and difficult Master’s Mate. Franchot Tone, who is rapidlv building for himself a place as the best of Hollywood’s younger actors, was convincing as Midshipman Byam: he has an attractive per¬ sonality, and is rapidly acquiring all the tricks. Of the remainder of an excellent cast we must single out Stanley Fields for his performance as Muspratt, and Francis Lister for his admirable vignette of Captain Nelson. One of the most remarkable things about Mutiny on the Bounty was that not only were all the tech¬ nical details correct, but that the actors wore their costumes as though they had lived in them for months, and not as though they had just taken them from a peg in the dressing room. Every thing about the production was right. In this picture the eighteenth century navy came to life again before our eyes with a reality that was really startling. The court-martial scene was parti¬ cularlv impressive. Yes. we must hand it to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for this film. Mutiny on the Bounty is a trium¬ phant vindication of the screen as an artistic medium, and what is more important. it proves con clusively that a succès d'éstime does not necessarily mean failure at the box office. Veritably a winner. Becky Sharp, the first full-length technicolour film to come to the Sylvia Cinema, was interesting as an experiment, but was spoilt by certain techni¬ cal defects. The colour, for instance, had the peculiar crudity that distinguishes the tinted views of 'The Wye at Hereford,’ or ‘The Toad Rock at Tunbridge Wells’ that we find in third-class rail¬ way carriages, and owing to some fault in focussing, the features of the actors were never sharp except in close-ups; indeed, the faces of the figures at the back of the screen indeed, were mere indistinguish¬ able blurs which made the figures themselves seem like lifeless dolls. But all the same, the film was reasonably good entertainment, although the story did not bear any great resemblance to Thackeray's masterpiece, on which, of course, it was based. Miriam Hopkins was perfectly cast in the name part, and Sir Cedric Hardwicke brought the wicked but fascinating Mar¬ quis of Steyne to life with great success. The acting honours, though, went to Nigel Bruce as Jos Sedley. This fine actor is especially suited to Regency parts, as those of us who saw him in The Scarlet Pimpernel will agree. He has to perfection the contours, the vinous hauteur, and the incipient apoplexy of the period; even his voice seems fruity with vintage port, awakening visions of Vauxhall and the bow window of White's. A delightful performance. Wallace Beery has such an outstanding per¬ sonality that we are apt sometimes to forget what a good actor he is. ‘If Beery is in a film, it's always worth seeing' we say, and thereby do him rather less than justice. In Viva Villa be lived the part of the simple, yet brutal, peasant leader who was able to rally his fellow peasants into a revolt which swept across Mexico, and which ended the rule of the land- lords who were crushing out the country’s life. He gave the character a certain simple dignity that made us overlook his primitive savagery; his coarse¬ ness and disgusting cruelty seemed merely the understandable foibles of an essentially great man,— which, incidentally, was probably very near the truth if we are to believe what has been written about Pancho Villa. This was an impressive film, contain¬ ing some beautiful photography and a good deal of brutality that might well have been cut out. Stuart Erwin was delightful as the hard-boiled American newspaper correspondent. A film of a very different sort was Trouble in Paradise, a slick, ultra-modern comedy with an all- star cast of seven, of whom the brightest luminaries were Herbert Marshall. Miriam Hopkins and Kay Francis. This story of two successful crooks was particularly well acted and directed, and bristled with wise-cracks. It held our attention all the time, but since it was produced by Ernst Lubitsch that was only to be expected. First Division News. MAY. Sixty-nine civil and sixty-five criminal cases came before the Kuching Courts during May. Of the latter, twenty-eight were for breaches of Muni- cipal bye-laws. A Dayak woman named Achoi attempted to commit suicide on the night of May 28th by cutting her throat with a razor. After being admitted to the General Hospital she was found to be mentally unbalanced. An inquiry into the death of a Chinese named Chu Kui was held at the 10th Mile. Penrissen Road, on May 8th. A verdict of death from natural causes was recorded. Mr. A. F. R. Griffin returned to Kuching on May 3rd after having spent a week cruising along the coast between Santubong and Tanjong Datu in a fruitless endeavour to apprehend smugglers. H.M.S. Herald, under the command of Com¬ mander N. A. C. Hardy. R.N., anchored at Pending on the evening of May 28th. Entertainments arranged for the ship’s company included hockey and football matches against Kuching teams. The District Officer, Ban, reports that there was no serious crime in the district during May. Four hundred and two persons were treated at Bau Government Dispensary during tie month, and 107 N.A.B. injections were administered. The dresser accompanied Mr. H. P. K. Jacks, Cadet, on his tour of the kampongs in the S. Tubah area. The District Officer records with regret the death of Towkay Liew Kim Siong, eldest son of the late Towkay Ah Tet, of Bau. Deceased, who was well known in mining circles, was 69 years of age, and leaves a widow, four sons, four daughters, and thirty- seven grandchildren. It appears that as a whole the Land-Dayaks in Upper Sarawak have had a better padi harvest than in previous years. Dalian Rubber Estates harvested 12,870 lbs. of dry rubber during Muy. Rainfall at Bau was 4.95 inches, and at Dahan 11.82 inches. At least two new gold-mining companies, The Oriental and The Lian Hap, arc in course of forma¬ tion. The former propose to work the old Monggak lease, while the latter will work an area in the neighbourhood of Pajiru. Among rhe visitors to Bau during the month were Dr. and Mrs. Pinkley. of New York, and Mr. Bein, of Peiping. The party visited many of the caves in the district in search of fossils, without any great success. Bau Club, which has been revived and re¬ registered, is proving a blessing to the Government staff as a whole. The following table gives the individual output of gold for April, 1936. by the various mining com¬ panies operating in Upper Sarawak:— The natives in the Lundu district have completed harvesting their padi crops, and all have nearly enough for the year with the exception of Kampongs Sejirin, Sebembnn and Skambal. These people have nothing to collect. Chai Kui, a Chinese of uncertain address, was sentenced to nine months’ R.I. for impersonating a Government servant and selling charms to Dayaks. In the Resident's Court a Dayak named Gedet, of Kampong Krosen. was charged with the murder of a Chinese, named Chen Ah Foo. The case was still adjourned at the end of the month. The padi harvest in the Samarahan area has been patchy, but most natives have more than enough for the year. At Moyan, however, the Sebuyow Dayaks harvested no crops at all. The condition of the Kuching-Serian Road has improved lately, and during May a motorcar was able to get through to Serian, this being the first time for five months. The District Officer, Serian. in the course of a report on a visit to the coastal area of his district, remarks that the Malay kampongs of Jaie and Tungkah are much dirtier than any Dayak village, the people not appearing to take any pride in their houses at all. Dahan Rubber Estates (1933) Limited. The Directors now submit their Report and Statement of Accounts for the twelve months ended the 31st December, 1935, duly audited. The Crop of Rubber for the twelve months amounted to 235,230 lbs., as against 272,850 Ibs. for the previous year The average net sae price was 5'24d. per lb., the f.o.b. cost being 4 5Id per lb. The reduced crop is accounted for by the increased restriction which is applied in Sarawak by tapping holidays, which amounted to six weeks, and by the refusal to allow any importation of labour. This has caused a labour shortage and a consequent loss of crop. During the present year a huger acreage will be tapped as about 100 acres of old Rubber on Dahan division, which were rested for four years, have now been opened again for tapping and parts of Estate "C" young clearings are also being brought into the tapping round Mr. W R. T. Picton-Warlow visited the Company's properly in November last and bis recommenda¬ tions have been of great assistance to the Board The Working Profit for the year mounted to £713 8s 4d.. to which has to be added Income Tax Recovered and Interest received, making the total of £799 14s. 9d. ; Debenture Interest and London Expenses amounted to £1.559 14s 4d . making a loss for the year of £759 19s. 7d., thus increasing the Debit Balance On Profit and Loss to £1,085 0s. 6d. The retiring Director is Mr. ALLAN HERBERT WYNN, who, being eligible, offers himself for re-election. The Auditors, Messrs. Peat, Marwick. Mitchell & Co. offer themselves for re-appointment.

Football. KUCHING 1. H.M.S. HERALD 0. On Sunday, 21st May, Kuching met H.M.S. Herald in a game of soccer on the Padungan ground. The Herald kicked off, and both teams came near scoring in the opening minutes, the Kuching goalkeeper being immediately tested with a long hard drive, while at the other end a breakaway on the Kuching right nearly proving productive. Kuching had most of the play territorially throughout this half and pressed the Herald goal repeatedly, but the light ball was difficulty to con¬ trol, and the home inside forwards wasted many excellent opportunities by ballooning the ball over the bar. At one period the Herald goalkeeper was obliged to throw himself at full length on several occasions to divert well placed shots round the post. Tn spite of this, however, it became early apparent that conditions were better suited to the visitors whose greater height and weight was a definite advantage with the light ball continually in the air. Their better ball control was another factor in their favour, and had it not been for the weak finishing of their forwards they might very well have gone ahead from one or two breakaways before the interval. At times the Kuching halves were very hard worked, and only the speed of the backs saved the situation Nevertheless, two or three drives from long range was all that Abang in the Kuching goal had to contend with before half time arrived with no scoring on either side. On the resumption of play Kuching immediately went ahead with a goal from Chater; a high centre from the right finding him unmarked on the opposite wing. Following this reverse the Herald redoubled their efforts and were unfortunate in not forcing a draw. In this half they were having equally as much, if not more, of the play than Kuching but the finishing of their forwards still left much to be desired. Kuching nearly went further ahead in the closing minutes when Seng Chiang, the home inside right, broke through only to be foiled a few yards from goal by the visitors’ goalkeeper who rushed out and took the ball from practically off bis toe. The Herald show signs of developing into a very useful side when their players have had the oppor¬ tunity of playing a few more games together, and Kuching only had their superior speed to account for their narrow win on this occasion.

Third Division News MAY. Twenty-six civil and fifty-eight criminal cases came before the Sibu Courts during May. A Dayak named Liom anak Tgoh was charged in the Resident’s Court, Sibu, with culpable homi¬ cide, as a result of one Makam having been found dead of a gunshot wound. The case was dismissed and the accused was retried under Dayak Undang- Undang and required to pay pati nyawa. On May 29th a Coroner’s inquest was held at Sibu upon the body of a female Chinese child aged 3. A finding of death by misadventure (drowning) was recorded. The District Officer, Sibu, records with regret the death on May 27th of Haji Iman, Tuan Imam of Igan. The land revenue collection for the Sibu district for May amounted to $7,747.17, shewing an increase of approximately $2,880 compared with the previous month. The map and notification of the constitution of the Pelagus Protected Forest were completed and forwarded to headquarters for ratification. The area of this forest is 20,000 acres approximately, and the boundaries are formed entirely by natural features. The Director of Public Works visited Sibu from May 8tl to 10th. The Clerk of Works visited Kanowit, Song and Kapit. Ninety patients were treated in Sibu hospital dining May. There were fifty-four discharges and five deaths. Five hundred and sixty-seven out-patients received treatment. Seventy-three N.A.B. in¬ jections were administered, and three hundred and thirty vaccinations were performed. The general health of all communities was good. A Foochow youth was connoted of house¬ breaking by night at Binatang and sentenced to two years’ rigorous imprisonment and a whipping; this sentence was duly confirmed. At Sarikei, a Foochow was sentenced to six months’ rigorous imprisonment for house-trespass. At Binatang, a Cantonese coolie, having tied a kerosene tin round his neck, throw himself from a Chinese launch into the river and went straight to the bottom. The body was recovered three days later, and a verdict of suicide by drowning returned. The general health of the Lower Rejang district was only fair during the month. There was a lot of influenza at Matu. At Binatang. a Dayak with two spear-wounds in his side was successfully treated in the dispensary. Very little rubber appeared in Sarikei and Bina¬ tang bazaars during May as tapping had been prohibited during the greater part of the month. The tapping holiday was again successful in every way, the only persons found tapping (on the first day of the holiday) being two old and illiterate Chinese living far away in the Sarik. From the facts of the case it was evident that the culprits had mistaken the date and had no dishonest intentions; they accordingly received only light punishment. The Government vegetable garden at Sarikei continues to prosper, but as yet the Dayaks cannot be persuaded to show much interest in it. Repairs to the last two miles of Jakar Road were in progress during May. The Repok Road is now in quite good condition for a distance of some five miles out of Sarikei. Sarikei Municipal roads were kept Well cleaned by prison labour. The reconstruction of 300 feet of the road in front of Binatang new bazaar progressed well, the driving of mangrove sheet-piling being almost completed. The felling of the jungle obscuring the Cape Sirik light was nearly completed by the end of the month. The Distrcit Officer, Kapit, reports that two Chinese were fined $1 each and costs for stealing Government fruit from behind the fort; it is pro¬ posed to deal severely with future offenders since most of the bazaar inhabitants appear to think that they have a perfect right to the fruit. No other cases calling for comment came before the Kapit Courts during the month. Penghulu Temonggong Koh and Penghnlus Sihat, Puso, Manok Manchal, Ugak and Jugah visited Kapit during the month. On May Sth Uring (/) anak Inja and her father Inja anak Limbeng of Rumah Bansa, Batang Balleh, were drowned near Nanga Mirirai when their boat capsized. The water was very high, and the other ten occupants of the boat were lucky to reach the bank. On May 29th a bitterly disputed case of butang (adultery) involving minor incest, which has apparently been outstanding for about three years lowing to the absence of accused, was settled in the fort by the District Officer, Native Officers, and Penghulu Temonggong Koh. The usual fines were, inflicted. This case had caused much trouble in the Balleh, and had led to the breaking up of Ramah Nyalu, the house of accused’s father. On May 29th, Matthew Shim, Court Writer, Song, proceeded to Sibu for medical treatment having accidentally shot himself in the foot while hunting. Clerk Lee Chin Shin was sent from Kapit to take his place. Towards the end of the month vast quantities of fish of many varieties returned upstream after the end of the high water, and some, excellent hauls with jalas were made up at Nanga Balleh. At Mukah Daud bin Taha was sentenced to three months' rigorous imprisonment, and twelve strokes of the rattan for an unprovoked attack, with a dangerous weapon, on his wife. Apart from this there was no serious crime in the district. On May 22nd a big cock-fighting 'main' was held between Balingian Dayaks and some 120 Sarawak Oilfields' Dayak coolies. On the first day the latter lost $800 in bets and were anxious to borrow more money from the company. It was thought advisable, however, to cancel the second day's proceedings. The prison demonstration vegetable garden at Mukah continues to flourish with very little attention, apart from weeding. The soya bean crop is doing exceptionally well. Reports of Dayak padi crops in the Mukah dis¬ trict are very poor except for a few houses in the ulu Slangau. All crops have now been harvested. As usual, the Dayaks blame rata and other pests, but it is obvious that they themselves are partly responsible for the failure owing to their inherent laziness and lack of the most elementary agricul- tural knowledge. They do not seem to be unduly perturbed by the prospect of a padi shortage, however, and will no doubt subsist, as usual in the circumstances, on wild sago, paku and other jungle products. The price of sago is slightly down at Mukah, the average top price during May being 56 cents per passu. An offer of $47 for the Mukah Government temuai has been accepted. This boat was of little use to Government owing to her weight and the large number of coolies required to paddle her. The District Officer, Oya and Dalat, commends the Constabulary for the amount of evidence colluded in the recent grave robbery case at Kam¬ pong Penat in spite of the resolute silence of the kampong people. It was not possible, however, to obtain a conviction, and the three accused Were discharged. Two inquests were heard during the month. Tn the first, Basi bin Legod of Kampong Sunegi Ud, Dalat, was killed by a falling tree whilst clearing jungle. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned on May 16th. Tn the second, Soh Eng Hock, Hokien. of Dalat. committed suicide by hanging himself in Dalat bazaar on the evening of May 29th. At the inquest held on May Both a verdict of suicide by strangulation was returned; there was no evidence to show the state, of deceased's mind at the time of his death. On May 12th Dresser Mohamed Lazaroo arrived at Oya and proceeded straight to Dalat where he is to be permanently stationed. The work of turning (he old offices into a dispensary and small hospital has been practically completed, and notices have been posted informing the public that a dresser is now stationed at Dalat and that they should, in their own interests, take advantage of this. During the twelve days that the dispensary was open, thirty-three persons were vaccinated, twenty- four N.A.B injections were administered and fifty- nine out-patients were treated. These figures are encouraging. Melanau fishing was in full swing during the month, good catches being obtained. The price of raw sago shows a decrease of 2 cents on the figures for last month, the figures being 62 cents per passu at the Kut, and 56 cents per passu at Dalat. The amount of raw sago exported from the dis¬ trict decreased during the month, the figures being By sea ... ... 205 koyans By Kut ... ... 19 224 This shows a total decrease of 192 1/2 koyans on the total exports for last month. One motor schooner, three motor launches, three schooners and thirty bandongs cleared Oya during the month, the total tonnage being 582 tons, a decrease over the figures for last month of 405 tons. In January last a notice was exhibited at Oya inforining the public that anybody found taking the young bamboo shoots from the Bamboo Avenue between the office and bungalow would be prose¬ cuted in the Police Court, as these bamboos were the property of the State and were to be preserved. This notice undoubtedly had the desired effect and many new shoots appeared. Unfortunately quite a number of these new shoots died when they were only three to four inches in height, presumably because they had insufficient earth to protect them. Owing to the temporary increase in the numbers of prisoners in the Oya jail, it has been found possible to surround each clump of bamboos with a border of belian attaps, and all the clumps have been filled in with earth to a depth of about a foot. It is hoped that the clumps will flourish again now as in former years. Fourth Division News. MAY. Messrs. L. N. Reynolds and R. G. Talbot of the Sarawak Constabulary arrived at Miri on May 19th, the former on a tour of inspection, and the latter to take over the Constabulary sector from Mr. D. V. Murphy. Work on the construction of the three new Government bungalows at Tanjong Lobang was practically completed by the end of the month; light, water and sanitation still have to be dealt with. Mr A. H. Noble, the General Manager of the Sarawak Oilfields, Ltd., and Mrs. Noble, left Miri on May 8th on furlough. The Right Rev. the Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak returned to Kuching by the same boat. On May 10th an interesting and important eVent took place at Lutong, namely the launching of a new sea-line. This task was accomplished success¬ fully, and without mishaps. The District Officer, Miri, reports that the first row of shop-houses at Sibuti has been completed and traders are moving in. The health of the Bintulu district was satis¬ factory in general during the month, although a good deal of sickness was reported amongst Dayaks in the Sebauh River. This appears to be a kind of fever which attacks people for three or four days. The District Officer, Bintulu, spent fourteen days during May travelling in the Kakus, Tatau and Anap Rivers. He visited all Bukitan, Punan and Dayak houses in these rivers, and reports that all natives appeared fairly contented. There were several reports of bad harvests, but as usual these were due more to laziness than bad luck, since last year many Dayaks left their farms, preferring to work logs or damar. There was a certain amount of grumbling about the forthcoming prohibition of tuba fishing, but those who chose to reflect were usually able to understand the objects underlying the introduction of this Order. The District Officer adds that since he was for¬ tunately able to borrow Dr. Morrow's outboard motor for this trip, it was done in about half the time that would have been taken had he used paddlcrs, and at about one quarter the Cost. Native tax has been coming in satisfactorily at Bintulu, there being very little outstanding at the end of the month. During May Mr. C. E. 0. Wood and Mr. C. E, Bailey of the Air Ministry, and Mr. R. E. Edwards of the Public Works Department, Kuching, visited Bintulu in connection with the landing-ground. A new scheme was drawn up and work has made very satisfactory progress. Tuanku Taha, Native Officer, Baram, reports that a Chinese named Chia Ah Nyit, aged about .35, was drowned on May 23rd at Lubok Nibong, Baram River, owing to the strong current capsizing his boat. The body was recovered on the evening of the 25th, and an inquest was held the following day. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned. Tuanku Mohamed, Native Officer, accompanied by Wan Haji Mohamed, Probationary Native Officer, left Marudi on April 28th for the ulu Baram; they were still away at the end Of the month. The Dresser-in-Charge went with them. Wan Suror, Native Officer, left Marudi on May 18th for Long Lama to supervise the auction of bird's-nests, aud from there he proceeded to the Tinjar and Bakong rivers to attend to Dayak affairs. The District Officer, accompanied by Wan Ali, Probationary Native Officer, left Marudi on May 25th for the Kelabit country, and will probably be away for three months. Three laksa of belian shingles and thirty-eight belian posts for the new bungalow at Baram arrvied from Bintulu by m.v. Margaret on May 10th. The Curator, of the Sarawak Museum, returned from the Kelabit country on May 19th, and left Marudi for Miri on the 21st. At Limbang a Bisayah was sentenced to three years’ rigorous imprisonment for theft of buffaloes, this being hie fourth conviction for this offence. Dayaks have already started clearing their new farms, and very few natives visited Limbang during the month. Penghulu Wee and Belulok. who accompanied the District Officer to Kuching for the races, returned home with a number of jars they had purchased in Kuching. Three more buffaloes were purchased by Dayaks from the Third Division for transport to Kanowit for farming purposes. The pepper harvest is being collected at Limbang, but does not promise to be quite up to last year's standard and the price is most disappointing. Semayong, Tagal prisoner, who escaped from prison in April, was tracked and recaptured by Dayaks in the jungle in the Lubai on May 6th. Mr. and Mrs. Tolley of the Borneo Evangelical Mission in the Lubai arrived towards the end of the month for an extended stay in Limbang. Both Mr. and Mrs. Tolley have unfortunately been laid up recently with fever. The District Officer, Lawas and Trusau, reports that a number of Muruts came down from Tengoa during the month to pay tax. Everything is quiet in the district, and natives arc preparing to clear their new farms. The Lawas (Sarawak) Estates, Ltd., exported 11,012 lbs. of dry rubber durng the month. A section of the Gaya Road was cleared during the tapping holiday. The Kuala Lawas Customs jetty became unuseable and has been repaired as well as possible with the money available. Communication between Lawas and Labuan was worse than ever during May since m.l. Sanang went into dock for survey. M.V. Brunei and s.S. Laubaine called at Tagai on May 16th and 15th respectively. The tapping holiday was, as far as can be judged, a complete success in the Lawas district. Three Inspectors were employed, and police patrols were put out every day. No cases of illegal tapping were reported. On May 13th the Assistant District Officer, Lawas, met the District Officer, Mempakul, at Sindumin, in connection with the alleged smuggling of rubber between B.N.B. and Merapok. It was decided that all possible precautions had already been taken CORRESPONDENCE. [The Editor is not responsible for the opinions of correspondents.] KUCHING,' . 4th June, 1936. The Editor, . SIR, In view of the recent controversy regarding the increase of the Royalty on gold to a flat rate of 10% ad valorem, the enclosed article entitled "Mining Royalties in the Empire,” which is taken from the May issue of the "Crown Colonist,” will probably be of interest to those of your readers who have invested in gold mines in Sarawak. The 10% Royalty is a tax of 10% of the total revenue of the Mine and this, coupled with the excessively high wages which coolies can now demand, through the shortage of labour conse¬ quent on the Government’s policy of restricting labourers entering Sarawak, will mean that some of the poorer mines cannot make a profit. The smaller producer and low grade propositions should be assisted and, as most of the gold ore in Upper Sarawak is of low grade, it would appear that a sliding scale of duty of, say, from 2 1/2 % ad valorem is essential. Yours faithfully, INTERESTED ONE. [Following a petition from representatives of the various gold-mining companies in Upper Sarawak, a Commission was recently appointed by Government to consider the question of royalty. This Commission heard a great deal of evidence, and after considering its report Government came to the conclusion that the mining companies had failed to make out any case for reducing the rate of royalty. Experience has proved that a sliding scale as advocated by the writer of this letter only encourages small, inefficient units, and that the existing flat rate of 10% is no burden to efficiently run concerns.—ED.] MINING ROYALTIES IN THE EMPIRE. Information gathered by the Mineral Resources Department of the Imperial Institute has been published in a volume entitled MINING ROYAL¬ TIES AND KENTS IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE (Imperial Institute, London, S.W. 7; 3s. 6d. nett). Some seventy-five officers of oversea Government departments replied to the comprehensive question¬ naire circulated by the Institute, and the data thus obtained, with that already available at South Kensington, therefore constitutes an authoritative work of reference on a subject of considerable im¬ portance to a large number of companies and individuals in the Empire. Most of the Colonies have mining industries of one kind or another, and the volume gives parti¬ culars of the royalties, export duties, and mining rents in force in East and West Africa, the Anglo- Egyptian Sudan, and Bechuanaland. In the West Indies there are Jamaica, Trinidad and the Leeward Islands; on the American mainland, British Guiana and British Honduras; and, off the southern extremity of the continent, the Falkland Islands. Asia is represented by Malaya, North Borneo, Ceylon, and Hong Kong; the Mediterranean region by Cyprus, Palestine and Trans-Jordan; and the Pacific by Fiji, New Guinea, and Papua. A list of Colonial territories in which no general mining legislation is in force includes Antigua, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Gambia, Malta, Mauritius, St. Kitts-Nevis, Seychelles, St. Vincent, Tonga, Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Virgin Islands. The main subject matter is divided into two parts. In the first, the statement for each country opens with a summary as regards the ownership and right to work minerals (whether vested in the Government or in private persons). Next follow details of royal¬ ties and export duties leviable on minerals and metals and the period, terms of renewal and "dead” or sub-surface rents of mining leases. Tn the second part the royalties and export duties detailed in part one have been summarised for reference purposes, under eight groups, i.e., coal; petroleum and natural gas; bituminous and oil shales; ores of iron and of the ferro-alloy metals; base metals; precious metals; precious stones; and miscellaneous minerals. Royalties levied on certain minerals are roughly uniform in many parts of the Empire, but in the case of other minerals wide divergence occurs, both as regards the amount and basis of the charge. Gold affords an example of rather widely varying rates and systems. In Great Britain rhe royalty levied is usually 2 to 4 per cent, of the value won. No royalty is charged on gold won from gold-mining leases in Queensland. Western Australia, or in New Zealand, but the last-named country’ levies an export duty. An ad valorem tax is favoured by many countries; the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan levies 2 per cent, while 5 per cent is specified iu Kenya, Tanganyika. Uganda, North Borneo, New Guinea, and Fiji. Southern Rhodesia graduates the tax between 2 1/2 and 5 per cent, according to the recovery of gold per ton of ore. Nigeria charges 6 per cent.; Sierra Leone. 9 per cent. and in South-West Africa and Sarawak, the rate is 10 per cent, ad valorem. On the other hand, a tax on profits is adopted by certain countries. Some countries assist the small producer by reducing the rate of royalty on small mineral outputs or profits, and others encourage the working of low-grade deposits in a similar manner. As regards tenure, most Empire Governments grant mining leases for definite periods, but a few encourage the operator to obtain the land in fee simple. Music at the Sylvia Cinema. KUCHING, 23rd June, 1936. The Editor, . DEAR SIR, We are all very much indebted to His High¬ ness the Rajah for having presented such an excellent Cinema to the town which has so greatly added to the amenities of the place, and such being the case one feels considerable diffidence in asking for any changes in connection with the entertainment, but might it be suggested that occasionally a better class of music is played instead of music-hall jazz and songs which are neither music nor singing at all, or the numti tumti tiddly-pom of Gilbert and Sullivan, which is very little better. Many people have, I know, remarked how great an improvement it would be on the evening's performance if some good music is given. I refer more particularly to the first half of the performance, the latter half has music which is suited to the piece that is being played generally. It is not necessary to have highly classical music as only the very few appreciate it, but surely there is a very large selection to choose from in Italian and German Operas, Liszt, Beethoven, or the works of many others in which there are pieces that are well-known and pleasing to listen to. It may be said that the Jazz stuff is better suited to natives, Chinese, and many others who are very much in the majority, that they should therefore be catered for and considered, the Europeans being only a handful, I quite agree this should be so, but the answer is that as far as the former are concerned in this respect, it will not make the slightest difference to them seeing that Western music conveys little or nothing to their minds and is only a noise —so they will be just as pleased. As those in the European community who only like music-hall jazz and songs have had their turn all this time, it would be a kindness now to let those who prefer something different have a turn as well. Thanking yon for allowing me space for this letter. I am, Yours faithfully. X. The Bicycle Menace. KUCHING, 29th June, 1936. The Editor, .. SIR, There would appear to be some 6,000 odd bicycles in Kuching and from some points of view this may be a good thing. But, since a large proportion of the 6,000 odd riders seem to think that the public roads exist solely for their con¬ venience, it is equally certain that from many other points of view, it is a very bad thing indeed. Can nothing he done to abate the bicycle nuisance in the streets of Kuching? There is, of course, the fact that the ease in getting a regulation framed is the exact measure of the difficulty experienced in getting it carried out. But sure, cyclist should not be allowed to ride more than two abreast and should be required to keep to the left-hand side of the road? Such a simple rule (if curried out) would add greatly to the comfort of the roads. If a fine should be the lot of the selfish cyclist what should be done to that most dangerous nuisance, the small boy (usually Malay) riding on a machine much too high for him? When he sits on the saddle the lack of control is obvious enough, but when, as is common, he rides standing on one pedal and with his other leg through the frame, he becomes a public nuisance. There will be a nasty, messy accident one day—and a careful motorist will probably get the blame. For these small sinners the application of Father’s hand or Mother's slipper would be most effectual. Perhaps the Teachers can do something? I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, TRAFFIC. THE . PRICE KUCHING, Tuesday, September 1st, 1936. 20 CENTS. The . TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1st, 1936. Local and personal. AUGUST We offer our heartiest congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Harry Roy on the birth of a daughter. The happy event took place in London on August 15th. From all accounts Dayang Elizabeth (Mrs. Harry Roy) has scored a notable personal success in the. film Every thing is Rhythm which opened recently in London, and which features Mr. Harry Roy and his celebrated dance band. We hope that we shall soon have an opportunity of seeing this picture at the Sylvia Cinema. Mr. A. W. D. Brooke is expected to arrive in Kuching on September 7th It is under¬ stood that Mr. Brooke is to be stationed at Nanga Meluan. Mr. Brooke is to be congratulated on having recently parted the Third (Proficiency) Standard of the F.M.S. Government Malay examination. This examination is not com pulsory for officers of the Malayan Civil Service who take Malay as a first language, and special sanction has to be obtained to study for it. Mr. H. B. Crocker returned from leave on August 3rd, and Mr. W. F. Dick, who acted as Government Secretary during his absence, has resumed the duties of Resident. First Division. Mr. F. H. Pollard has been appointed Secretary for Native Affairs, and Mr. G. F. .1. Pegler continues to act as District Officer, Kuching. It is with deep regret that we announce the death of the Rev. Father Vincent Halder which occurred in Singapore on August 16th. An obituary notice appears in another ' column. We welcome back Dr. W. Hutchison and Mr. F. A. Moore, who returned from furlough on August 17th. Mr. Moore came in for a little excitement at Gibraltar since a bomb was dropped quite close to the Chitral, the vessel in which he was travelling, and he saw some rather sensational manoeuvres on the part of a flotilla of Spanish destroyers Mr. Moore, who will relieve Mr. G. R. H. Arundell as District Officer, Lubok Antu, when the latter goes on home leave towards the end of next month, left for Simanggang by the Maimnna on August 21st, having first paid a flying visit to Sibul. During its stay in Kuching the circus, which we mentioned last month, drew large crowds every night. The circus troupe worked hard and gave excellent perfor¬ mances, some of the turns being strikingly good. They thoroughly deserved their success, which we hope will be, repeated else¬ where. The proprietors are to be congratulated on a courageous enterprise. The sixty first birthday of the passed off quietly on August 26th. Reports from the coast state that the sago plantations between Matu and the Igan are suffering from a plague of bears. These creatures even swim the Igan river and create havoc in the gardens on the Dalat side. The owners of sago gardens are being permitted to buy buckshot, but it is doubted whether they will be able to do very much to combat the menace. In the meantime children in the neighbourhood of the Igan would be well advised to refrain from ill-timed pleasantries about the hairlessness of their elders’ pates. Mr. E. 0. Bruce arrived in Kuching on August 10th, having travelled out from Europe to Singapore by air, and left for Limbang on August 13th. Visitors to Kuching during the month included Mr. J. B. Archer, Resident, Fourth Division, Mr. H. E. Cutfield, and Dr. A. D. Hutchison. Mr. Archer and Mr. Cutfield arrived by the Maimuna on August 20th, and Dr. Hutchison, who is at present on local leave, arrived from Sibu on August 7th and left for Singapore on the 24th. Mr. Archer, who was in Kuching on duty, returned to Miri on the 26th by the Maimuna, which had previously taken Mr. Cutfield to Simanggang. Mr. Cutfield is to act as Resident, Second Division, during Mr. P. M. Adams’ absence on furlough. Mr. A. Macpherson was appointed Acting District Officer, Nanga Meluan. on August 19th, and left for his new station on the same dav. The bort at Meluan, which is constructed of solid belian on a concrete base, should be completed early in September, but owing to difficulties of transport all furniture has to he made on the spot, so the Fort will not be readv for permanent occupation until the middle of October. Dr. E. M. Marjoribanks, Principal Medi¬ cal Officer, left Kuching on furlough by the Marudu on August 29th. Dr. W. Hutchison has been appointed to act as Principal Medi- cal Officer during Dr. Marjoribanks’ absence. Mr. Rudolf Gotte, an expert on forestry and timber from the Bangkok branch of Messrs, the Borneo Company Ltd., arrived in Kuching by the Marudu on August 12th. He left for Sibu on August 24th, accompanied by Mr. B. J. C. Spurway, Divisional Forest Officer, Third Division, and we understand that he intends to visit certain timber-bearing areas in the interior of the Third Division. We welcome back Mrs. N. A. Middlemas, who arrived in Kuching on August 24th. after leaving Miss Jill Middlemas at school at Cameron’s Highlands. Obituary. It is with the deepest regret that we have to record the death of the Bev. Father Vincent Halder which took place in the General Hospital, Singapore, on Sunday, August 16th. Father Halder had been in failing health for nearly a year. In August, 1935, he developed symptoms of a malignant disease of the throat which necessitated a visit to Singapore for special treatment. After spending some months in Singa¬ pore Hospital, he returned to Sibu apparently in good health, and certainly in excellent spirits. It was known, though, that the malady from which he was suffering was incurable, and towards the end of May he left Sibu for the last time. While in Singapore he stayed at the Procure of the Missions Etrangères, receiving treatment nt the General Hospital. The French Fathers state that until August 9th he lived his ordinary life, smoking his celebrated pipe 'all day long,’ and eating with Ilia customary appetite. On the 9th, however, he was taken suddenly ill; he was admitted to hospital the following morning, and it was soon apparent that he had only a few days to live. It is good to know that during these last few days he was comparatively free from pain, as far as can he ascertained,—indeed, shortly before his end he is said to have felt so much better that he refused to believe that he was in any danger. When two Fathers from the French Mission went to see him the day before he died, he told them that he was considerably improved; in proof of this it is interest¬ ing to note that the Fathers were asked by the Hospital authorities to cut short their visit, since in spite of doctors' orders Father Halder (charac¬ teristically !) would not stop talking, and it was feared that this might be too great a strain for hi i in his enfeebled condition. At 4 p.m. on August 16th two Fathers arrived at the Hospital just in time to be present at the end. Father Halder, who had received Extreme Unction a day or two previously, was quite calm, and although incapable of speech, he was conscious and certainly understood the prayers of the two priests. He passed away peace¬ fully at 4.15 p.m., and his body was taken to the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, where it lay in state until the following morning, being watched over by several Chinese Catholics during the night. Early on Monday morning Mass was sung, and at 5 p.m. on the same day Vespers for the Dead were held, the Bishop of Malacca presiding. All the Roman Catholic clergy of Singapore, including French, Belgian and Portuguese priests to the number of over twenty were present, with several Brothers and a congregation of three or four hundred people. This assemblage was a fitting tribute to the memory of one who throughout his whole life was concerned not with any one race or group of races, but with humanity, and who even in Singapore, where he was not widely known, was loved and respected. During his few months in Singapore he left the imprint of his unique and charming personality on all with whom he came in contact, and in a letter to the Prefect Apostolic of Sarawak the Procurator of the French Mission states that “All priests here regret the death of Father Halder, he was so good and so simple, never complaining, al ways satisfied.” When the news of Father Halder's death reached Sibu, the Mission was thronged during most of the day with people of all races, who came to express their sympathy. Father Halder's body was sent from Singapore to Sibu by s.s. Katong, and he was buried there on August 25th. It is fitting that Father Halder lies not in a strange land, but in the one place of all others that he himself would have chosen,—the place which for so many years was the centre of his work for the Mission and for Sarawak, and with which his name will always be associated. A full account of the funeral will be found under Third Division News. Father Halder, or ‘Apai’ as he was always known, was born near Innsbruck in the Tyrol in 1878. He was ordained Priest in 1902, and arrived in Sarawak in February, 1903, going almost at once to Kanowit, where he was stationed for the next three years. In 1906 he was transferred to Sibu where, apart from furlough and a short interval in Jesselton, he remained until his departure for Singapore this year. Almost the whole of his thirty-three years’ service in Sarawak was therefore spent in the Rejang River area, and it is there more than anywhere else that his memory will live in the hearts of his friends and in the fruits of his labour. At the start of his career as a missionary Father Halder’s work lay among the Sea Dayaks, and although after his transfer to Sibu he was chiefly concerned with the Chinese in general and Foo- chows in particular, he never lost his love for the Dayaks, and retained always a lively interest in them and their doings. But Father Halder's benevolence was not confined to those among whom he spread his Message; his warm heart knew no barrier of race, colour or creed, and his abounding sympathy embraced all humanity. Affliction and distress were the only credentials he recognized, and no one in trouble ever went to him in vain, or failed to draw new strength and gladness from the over- flowing well of his understanding and compassion. He went about among his fellow men a perpetual fount of happiness and encouragement, doing good by stealth, and bringing out the best in everyone by the mere fact of his presence. With his battered terai, his vast beard, his pipe, and his infectious laughter ‘Apai’ was a familiar figure up and down the Rejang River, where he will be missed so long as there remains a single person who remembers him. It was impossible not to love him.—his absolute simplicity and what can only be described as the saintliness of his life were combined with a delightful sense of fun; his eyes were rarely without a twinkle, and a smile was never far from his lips. To the end he never lost his wonder and delight in the ordinary business of living, and his high spirits and enthusiasm were very refreshing in a world where pessimism is becoming more and more prevalent as the years go on. Tn Father Halder the Mission has lost a devoted servant, and Sarawak a true friend. Let it be our consolation that although men such as he pass from among us, they do not die: they live on in our hearts, where their memory remains forever fresh and fragrant, and where their example of sacrifice, love and selfless generosity endure as a constant reminder that their lives on earth were not wasted. The Next War. Actuaries, it seems, are not the only people who can gauge our expectation of life through the medium of cold, hard figures, says The Ukapian. This artless Little computation, now going the rounds, has convinced many outside the insurance world that Great Britain’s next war is going to lake place—horrible thought—in a year’s time Sarawak Rubber Estates, Limited. Report of the proceedings at the Twenty-fourth Annual Ordinary General Meeting held at the Office of the Company, 143-149, Fenchurch Street, London, E.C. 3, on 17th July, 1936, Mr. John Kenneth Henderson (the Chairman of the Com¬ pany) presiding. Mr. G. A. Wigney, f.o.l.s., the Representative of the Secretaries (The Borneo Company, Limited), having read the notice convening the meeting and the Report of the Auditors, the Chairman said : The Directors’ Report and Accounts having been in your hands for the prescribed period, I will with your permission take these as read. The result of the year’s operations, after pro¬ viding £1,000 for depreciation, is a profit of £3.955. 18s. 9d., against £5,606. 6s. 7d. for last year. This smaller profit is mainly accounted for bv the reduced crop, and the system of tapping which we have been compelled to adopt. It has also been affected to a small extent by an increase in labour costs. I shall have something to say on both these matters later. Including the carry forward from last year of £2.111. 10s. 9d . the amount at credit of Profit and Loss Accounts is £6,067. 9s. 6d. Out of this sum your Directors recommend the payment of a dividend of 4 per cent., less fax, which will absorb £3,660, and the transfer of £130. 8s. 11d., to Reserve for Contingencies, increasing this to £1,000. out of which approximately £700 in respect of Income Tax will have to be paid. Referring to the Balance Sheet you will observe that there is an addition to Estate Property Account of £452. 9s. 8d. representing the cost of additional tanks in the factory, and of another smokehouse. As you were informed in the report, the area of the Estate has been reduced by 678 acres, which represented Reserve Laud entirely unsuited to rubber planting. Hitherto we had held this land rent free, but under the terms of our lease we were due to pay quit rent on it as from 1st January, 1936, and your Directors therefore decided to surrender the land to the Government. As the result of a recent survey made by the Authorities, the planted area has been given as 2,674 acres. The rubber crop harvested during the year amounted to 636,073 lbs., a decrease of 62.909 lbs., on the previous year. The imposition of tapping holidays by the Government amounting to 65 days during the year fully accounts for the smaller production. Costs were thereby consider- ably increased as we had to maintain our labour force during the periods when no crop was being harvested. Although, as I intimated to you last year, the Government have set up an Assessment Committee, they have not yet granted assessments to indivi¬ dual Estates, but continue to impose tapping holidays, as a means of limiting the total exports of rubber to the volume allowed the territory under the Restriction Scheme. During the first nine months of the current financial year, five periods have so far been fixed totalling 99 days in all, which must add to our costs for this year. With a view to minimising the effect of this policy the Labour Force is being employed on cultivation work during these periods, but it can readily be realised how difficult it is to work on an economic basis under these conditions. We are also pro- ihibited from exporting any grades of scrap rubber, and this will have its effect on our Estate working results. We have, in all circumstances, reluctantly decided to abandon our self-imposed restriction by way of rotational tapping in favour of full fapping between the holiday periods. It is this change in system which has necessitated the expenditure on additional coagulating tanks and smokehouse accommodation already referred to. Care is being taken to ensure that the con¬ sumption of bark shall be approximately the same as hitherto. The Estate, which was recently inspected by our Visiting Agent has been well reported on, as being in a generally healthy condition. The drainage system has been maintained and an efficient programme of cultivation carried out, both of which have contributed greatly to the good order obtaining on the property. The Directors are well satisfied with the performance of the new factory. The Board have in view the question of improve¬ ment and/or replanting of some of the older areas, and to this end experiments in chemical manuring of selected areas are now taking place, while nurseries arc being set up for the supply of proved seedlings and steps are being taken to obtain supplies of budwood from selected clones. Our labour force has been kept together at com¬ paratively small cost under difficult conditions, and is at present just sufficient to meet our requirements. We have reason to know that other estates have suffered badly, and great credit is due to our Manager, Mr. MacDonald for the good position in which we find ourselves. The Government, however, still persist in their prohibition on the importation of fresh labour, and while our force as a whole is at present contented, the local demand for labour and the rates of pay being offered are such that the loyalty of our coolies is being severely taxed. We may, therefore, before long be faced with the alternative of further considerable increases in pay or the loss of numbers of our labourers. However, I do not wish to end on a pessimistic note, and subject to no further difficulties arising during the present financial period, your Directors believe the Company should have a reasonably successful year if present prices are maintained. In conclusion I am sure you will agree that our best thanks are due to the staff on the Estate for the efficient manner in which the work has been conducted during the year as well as to our Agents at home and in the East for their constant care and attention at all times. I will now propose:- That the Report and Accounts as submitted be approved and adopted, and I will ask Colonel Harvey to second the resolution. After that I shall be pleased to deal with any questions you may care to ask. There being no questions, the Chairman put the motion to the meeting, and it was carried unanimously. The Chairman moved:—That a dividend be declared for the year ended 31st March, 1936, of 4 per cent., less tax at 4s. 9d. in the £, payable on the 1st August, 1936, to Shareholders on the register on 7th July, 1936. This was seconded by Mr. Malcolm and carried unanimously. The Chairman then proposed and Colonel Harvey seconded the re-election of Mr. A. R. Malcolm as a Director and this was carried unanimously. On the proposal of Mr. T. Edwards, seconded by Mr. D. T. Lewis, Messrs. Turquand, Youngs & Co., were re-appointed Auditors at a remunera¬ tion of 40 guineas. Mr. Lewis proposed a hearty vote of thanks to the Directors which was carried unanimously. The proceedings then terminated. Notice to Holders of Roumanian Loans. By Article 3 (1) of the Anglo,Roumanian Pay¬ ments Agreement of 2nd May, 1936 (Cmd. 5174) it is provided that amounts allocated under the Agreement to the Service of the Public Debt of Roumania and of the Monopolies Institute 7 per cent. Guaranteed Sterling Bonds are to bo used for payments in respect of Securities which are shown to the satisfaction of H.M. Government to have been on 4th May. 1936, in the ownership of British Holders as defined in that Article. The Treasury have authorized the Paying Agents of each of the loans concerned to overstamp bonds which were in the ownership of British holders on 4th May, 1936, and have requested the Paying Agents to issue the following notice to Bondholders : NOTICE. Nonce is hereby given that the Paying Agents of bonds of the undermentioned Loans have been requested and authorized by H.M. Treasury to undertake the overstamping of those Bonds which were on 4th May, 1936, in the ownership of a "British Holder” as defined below : (1) Persons of whatever nationality ordinarily resident or ordinarily carrying on business in the United Kingdom; or (2) British subjects wherever resident and cor¬ porations incorporated by or under the laws of the United Kingdom, or of any other territory under the Sovereignty of His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, or under His Majesty’s suzerainty, protection or mandate, and Governments and public authorities in those territories; or (3) Persons under His Majesty’s protection and ordinarily resident or ordinarily carrying on business in the United Kingdom or any other of the territories aforesaid. Accordingly, British holders of the under¬ mentioned Bonds should lodge their Bonds for over stamping with the respective Paying Agents, together with Certificates of British Ownership as defined above, signed by a British Banker or Stock¬ broker. Listing forms can be obtained from the Paying Agents. Delay in presenting bonds for overstampping may entail delay in receiving payment of the coupons thereon if and when funds for such payment are available. A Note On Food. 11. Last month I hud some rather hard things to say about English cooking. In general they were deserved, but there is, of course, one branch of cookery in which we excel,—the cooking of meat. When it comes to chops, steaks and joints, the English stand supreme; they are the high priests of the oven and the gridiron, the acknowledged past- masters of the basting ladle and the spit. Unfortunately, though, this great gift is of little practical value in Sarawak, since in the outstations —and it is with outstations that this article is chiefly concerned—meat is just the one thing that is usually unobtainable. Apart from the larger centres where one can get cold storage products (and where in consequence there is no excuse at all for inferior meals), English cookery is to all intents and pur¬ poses a wash-out in Sarawak, and the sooner we realize this fact, the better for our stomachs and tempers. Instead of sighing vainly for fillet steak and saddle of million, we should pul nil thoughts of Simpson's, the Cheshire Cheese and the George and Vulture resolutely behind us and see that what can be done with the materials that are ready to our hand. These, in the main, are eggs, fish, shellfish, poultry and certain kinds of vegetables. Game is also obtainable in the shape of snipe, pigeons of various kinds and deer, but it cannot be depended upon and so must be regarded as something of a luxury. For those who like it. Chinese-bred pork is usually to be had wherever there is a bazaar; Dayak pork is generally (and rightly) regarded as dangerous,—it is certainly unpalatable, and so need not be considered here. The same applies to wild pig- This is not really such a bad list, taken all round. It is one which many housewives would consider more than adequate,—but not in England, j Throughout middle-class England meat is still the staple food of the family, the pièce de rèsistance of every meal. Eggs and fish are regarded as kick¬ shaws which only serve to whet the appetite for the main course, of which vegetables are merely the unconsidered accessories. The gastronomic life of the ordinary English family centres with an almost religious fervour round the weekly joint,—hot on Sunday, cold on Monday, as the Co-optimists used to sing, and disguised in various forms for the rest of the week. The Sunday joint is not just, a chunk of red meat and bone,—it is far, far more than that; it is a cult, a portent, a symbol. It is the incarna- tion of the spirit of bourgeois Britain, and as such it exercises a baleful dominon over a large section of the population of the British Isles. Unfortunately its influence reaches beyond the seas, and it is this blind joint-worship that condemns the Englishman abroad to the kind of meals that he has to eat; the kind of meals, we might add, that no one but he would eat. On the Continent, though, things are different. In France and Southern Europe butcher’s meat is usually expensive and bad. The inhabitants of these benighted regions therefore do without it to a great extent, and specialize in the cooking of eggs, fish, shellfish, poultry and vegetables, with game as a side-line. And believe me, they do not do so badly, either; in the course of the past few centuries the frogs, wops and dagoes have evolved a highly individual code of cookery which at its worst guarantees that no meal shall ever be insipid, and which at its best produces dishes of great variety and surpassing excellence. You get the idea? Briefly, it is that if we wish to live like civilised human beings in Sarawak we should forget all our inherited ideas on the subject of food, and abandon for ever the attempt to apply the British cookery convention in a country where it is entirely unwork¬ able owing to me lack of first essentials. We should adopt instead the Continental method, which is exactly suited to local conditions; we should free ourselves from the tyranny of the joint, and burst the shackles of custom and tradition. If we take this line, there is no reason at all why we should not live very nearly as well in Sarawak as they do ou the Continent. Those of my readers who have lived abroad may think that this is an exaggeration, but it is not; it is really astonishing what one can do with the materials available in the average outstation, given the will, and perhaps the skill. But it is the will that matters; that little touch of elbow grease is nine tenths of the battle A few minutes each day devoted to the kitchen will produce results that are altogether incommensurate with the time and effort expended. III. Before going any farther, it might perhaps bo as well to state quite definitely that this article does not pretend to be a sort of condensed cookery book; there are plenty of these on the market, and they contain hundreds of good recipes. All that I am modestly trying to do is to establish general principles, to prove that food need not necessarily be uninteresting in the tropics, and to show you the way to brighter and better meals. Perhaps the best way to do this is to come down to brass tacks and produce a few examples. Eggs, fish, shellfish, poultry and vegetables,— that is our list Let us take these things one by one and see what can be done with them. In Sarawak, eggs are usually prepared in only four ways,—boiled, poached, scrambled or fried. It is not easy to go wrong with the first three, but how often does one get an egg that has been pro¬ perly fried,—an egg, that is, with the edges of the while crisp and brown, and the yolk still liquid? Almost never. Yet it is so easy; all one has to do is to ensure that the fat in which the egg is cooked is hot enough. Yes, ladies, it is as simple as all that. Again, eggs as a rule are only served for break¬ fast. But there is no reason at all why they should not form one of the courses, or even the chief course, at luncheon or dinner. For instance, many savoury entries can be evolved if various ingredients are added to scrambled eggs as they are being whisked in the pan; chopped up mush¬ rooms or pimentos, cubes of bacon, peas, sauté potatoes, grated cheese, minced chicken's liver and minced ham are some suggestions.—it is easy enough to think of others. Scrambled eggs served in this way and garnished with slices of toast crisply fried in butler make an excellent light luncheon dish, and form an effective substitute for fish at dinner. A rather more substantial dish can be made from eggs done in the Spanish fashion. These are simply fried eggs—but properly fried, please,— dished up on top of a heap of rice fried with a little saffron and garnished with small sausages, fried bananas, and pimentos. (Since pimentos come into this article a good deal, one way and another, I had better take this opportunity of saying that they can be grown locally without difficulty, and that seeds can be obtained from the Department of Agriculture). But the king of all egg dishes, of courses, is the omelette. So much has been written about the cooking of omelettes that it would only be a waste of time to go into details here. It is enough to say that the true omelette consists of beaten up egg mixed with a little butter and a pinch of salt and cooked in butter. The result should be golden in colour, firm on the outside and semi- liquid within : it should not be the kind of foamy abomination that only too often masquerades as an omelette in Sarawak. Omelettes are delicious plain, but they are also excellent when filled with the ingredients 1 have suggested in connection with scrambled eggs. There is, however, one variety of omelette—the Spanish—that deserves special mention, since it is not only unusual and easy to make, but a meal in itself. Here are the directions :— Proceed as for a French omelette, but to the beaten up egg add small cubes of boiled potato, a few chunks of tomato, sliced pimentos, some peas, a pinch of salt and a liberal dash of paprika. Cook in the ordinary way. but do not try to fold,— just turn it over quickly and let it retain the shape of the pan. The result should be a delicious mass of eggs, vegetables and spices round in shape and about an inch thick. It is, I hope, unnecessary to add that omelettes of any kind should be served the moment they are ready; the slightest delay is fatal. Well, that is enough about eggs. It would be possible to discourse for hours about the subtleties of cefs bonne femme (eggs baked with mushrooms and butter) and cefs à la crème (eggs lightly baked with spices and thick cream) but time does not permit, and, as I have said, there are plenty of cookery books in the world. Let us proceed to the next item on our list. With the possible exception of duai and ikan merah the fish caught round the Sarawak coasts are apt to be rather tasteless unless eaten fresh from the sea. which is not always possible. They should therefore be served with a rather strongly- flavoured sauce,—and when I say sauce, I do not mean a pungent liquid out of a bottle but a real sauce prepared in the kitchen. These are endless in variety, and the basis of most of them is butler melted in a pan, thickened with a little flour, and then moistened with milk, wine or stock and possibly thickened again with yolk of egg just before serving. When making sauces from tinned vegetables—mushrooms, for instance,—they should be cooked for only about half the time stated in the recipe, and the liquor from the tin should be mixed with the stock used for the body of the sauce. Bouillon cubes make a very good substitute for stock, incidentally. Good accompaniments for local fish are tomato or cheese sauce (don't stint the cheese.) mushroom sauce, (add a glass of port wine if you arc feeling extravagant,) lemon sauce (ordinary white sauce plus the juice of two limes, butter and cream.) and of course, curry sauce; and sauce tartare makes all the difference to fried fish. This is merely a stiff mayonnaise mixed with finely-chopped capers, and since it has a distinctive and delicious flavour it is invaluable as a garnish not only for fish but for cold vegetables, and sometimes also for meat. Reinember, though, that mayonnaise consists of yolk of egg, olive oil and vinegar, and nothing else, —unless you care for garlic, that is. People who add milk or cream to this exquisite preparation are guilty of a serious crime and one which would meet with swift and drastic punishment in any properly organised society. Never serve boiled fish with white sauce. One has nightmare memories of watery lumps of senangin weltering in bill-sticker's paste on which it is perhaps as well not to dilate. Anchovies are a good dressing for fish that is steamed or boiled,— if you must eat fish done in this way. Fish salads are easily prepared and make an appetising first course. Cut some cold cooked fish into small cubes, mix with boiled potato and beet¬ root also cut in cubes, add onion to taste, a little pimento, salt and coarse white pepper, and dress with oil and vinegar whisked into a fairly stiff emulsion. See that there is plenty of dressing, and mix it thoroughly with the salad. Most kinds of Sarawak sea fish, though somewhat kicking in flavour, have firm white flesh and are therefore well suited for stewing since the flesh does not disintegrate during the process of cooking. Fish stews are very good if intelligently flavoured, and if you want to go a bust there is always matelote, that glory of French cooking which consists of white fish cut in chunks and stewed in red wine with onions, mushrooms, and spices. And let us not forget bouillabaisse, that delicate but satisfying dish that is both a soup and a stew; I have eaten bouillabaisse in Sarawak which would pass muster in Marseilles, and that is saying a lot. The in¬ gredients are fish, prawns or sea-crayfish, mussels (use the local cockle called krang,— it is excellent,) potatoes, spices, and saffron, with a touch of curry powder. Mention of prawns brings us to shellfish, a valuable article of food in Sarawak which can often be obtained in places where one cannot get fish. And yet how little is done with them ! They usually appear on the table either cold and liberally dowsed with furniture-cream, or else fried until they have lost all their flavour. Yet they can be prepared in all lands of different ways, and offer splendid opportunities for imaginative cookery. The udang gala, or large sea crayfish, is very nearly as good as the langouste. which the French rate, higher than the lobster. This crayfish is first- class boiled and served cold with mayonnaise, and it can lake the place of lobster in all recipes dealing with that delectable crustacean. It is superb, for instance, cooked à Vamericaine, and this dish is not nearly so difficult as most people think. Sea prawns (udang sia) have more flavour than their fresh-water cousins, but both varieties make an excellent bisque, or thick soup. The recipe can j be found in almost any cookery book, but it is im- portant to remember that a lot of the flavour of prawns lies in their shells, which should not be removed until just before the soup is served. A good stock for bisque of prawns can be made from fish heads and bones to which have been added a number of prawn or crayfish shells pounded up in a mortar. One of the best ways to eat sea prawns, provided they are freshly caught, is to boil them in saltwater to which a little vinegar has been added and then deal with them while they are still hot. When cooked in this way prawns retain all their flavour; stout and brown bread and hotter arc the traditional accompaniments Crabs are first-class in Sarawak, and can be pre¬ pared in a number of ways. If they can be obtained with ‘coral,’ so much the better,—pound this up and use it to dress them, if served cold. The meat from the shell should be shredded, mixed with the pounded coral and some mayonnaise and flanked with the claws; the whole should be garnished with lettuce and cucumber and put on the icc for an hour or so before serving. Crabs also make a good soup on the lines of a prawn bisque, and they can be baked in their shells with butter and bread-crumbs. The local clam (locan) is rather tough, but is use¬ ful for flavouring soups and fish stews. Krang, which resemble little cockles, make delicious makan kechil,—they should be plunged in boiling water for only a few seconds and eaten at once. No remarks on Sarawak fish would be complete without some mention of umai, the national dish of Melanau fishermen. To prepare umai take a good- sized duai, clean it, scale it. wash it in salt water, and cut it in thin slices. Lay these on a board and spinkle with asam paya and the juice of fresh limes. Leave for half an hour or so then place in a shallow dish with some vinegar and a few sliced chillies. You will find this an excellent hors d’oeuvres. Umai can be made with any white fish, provided it is absolutely fresh, but connoisseurs prefer duai. To taste umai at its best one should eat it in a barong fifteen miles out to sea. (to be continued.) The British North Borneo (Chartered) Company. We. print below extracts from the speech made by Major-General Sir Neill Malcolm, K.C.B., D.S.O., who was in the chair at the Ninety-ninth General Meeting of Share¬ holders of the British North Borneo Company held at River Plate House, Finsbury Circus, London, E.C. 2, on June 16th, 1936. These extracts are taken from the full text of the speech published in the British North Borneo Herald. “THE CHAIRMAN : Ladies and Gentlemen, I rise to move the adoption of the Report and Accounts for the year ended the 31st December, 1935, and although I have no doubt you have studied them both very carefully—they were sent out on the 5th instant—I am going to take the liberty of saying something on one or two features which seem to me to be of particular interest and importance—and I am going to divide my remarks into two parts, firstly in regard to our trading profit and secondly in regard to debt reduction. “It is often said, and with a good deal of reason, I am afraid, that this Company has been unduly burdened with debt. That is an old story which I need not examine now, as I am sure you are all only too familiar with it. The Debenture debt at present absorbs nearly all our working profits. We are therefore always faced with the dual problem of how to increase our trading surplus so as to try to pay interest on the ordinary capital, and at the same time to reduce the burden of debt so that the Debenture interest will not eat up such a large proportion of such trading profits as we make. “Now I must at once admit that, so far as increas¬ ing our trading surplus is concerned, 1935 has been a very disappointing year, and all that we are able to show you to-day is an improvement of £5,000 over 1934. This mediocre and disappointing result is almost entirely due to the incidence of rubber restriction. As you will see from the last page of our accounts, if you will turn to them, the value of rubber exported during the year under review was no less than £126,000 below that of the previous year. 1935 has been a difficult year all through in the rubber industry—owing, of course, to the restric¬ tion policy (I think a very wise one) which has been adopted—but it is universally admitted that North Borneo has been hit more hardly than any other producing country. I do not think it is necessary for me to discuss here how this unfortunate state of affairs has come about. It is sufficient to know that our peculiarly unfortunate situation is now universally acknowledged. I fear that nothing now can be done to improve that situation relatively to other producers during this first period of restriction, and we must content ourselves with so preparing our case as to ensure better treatment when the whole scheme comes up for revision during 1938. With that object in view we are, with your per¬ mission, sending Sir Andrew McFadyean, who is our representative on the Rubber Committee, to Borneo this year, so that he can study the problem on the spot and present our case with full authority and first-hand knowledge when the time comes. With our case in his hands we will be assured of first-class advocacy, as I think his colleagues on the Committee will be very ready to admit. Even then there will be difficulties, and 1 personally do not envy the Rubber Committee their task. As an instance of what lies ahead of us, I might quote Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad of March 17th, which stated that ‘based on preliminary results of native rubber registrations, the potential production of native rubber should he estimated at not less than one million tons a year’ —that amount is in regard to native rubber alone— ‘which is considerably more than the 1936 export quotas of all the restriction countries put together.’ Those quotas were based upon 60 per cent, of the International quota. ‘Also that the number of native garden owners was considerably greater than was at first believed, and as far as could be ascertained at the moment, ran to more than 500,000.’ That is a problem which will have to be reviewed during next year and 1938, when the allotments of the various producing countries come up for revision if restriction is to be continued, as 1 think most people are agreed should be. “I am glad to say that this year in certain ways looks better than last, as lubber prices are distinctly higher and rather larger quantities are being released as from the 1st July. Increased exports means increased purchasing power, which brings heavier imports, with; we hope, better figures for the Railways. “I will now turn to the administrative side of our business. A marked and very important feature of Mr. Jardine’s administration is his very active per¬ sonal interest in the welfare of the native population, more particularly in regard to health and education, for which he is doing everything that our slender financial resources will permit. “Even more important, perhaps, as an enquiry, which has recently been instituted, into the health of the native population, particularly that of the more remote tribes of the Interior Everyone connected with our administration—especially, I may say, our Principal Medical Officer, Dr. Dingle —has Jong been disturbed aud puzzled by the stationary figures of our native population. Not only does there appear to be little natural increase, but amongst the Maruts there is an absolute decrease. We all know how extraordinarily difficult it is to get reliable statistics of this kind from a primitive population, but the last Census, in 1931, seemed to put the matter clearly and beyond doubt. It was then revealed that while the total native population had increased in ten years by no more than I per cent., among the Muruts there was a decrease of nearly 20 per cent. I have a number of figures here in regard to the different tribes—figures with which 1 do not propose to trouble you at this moment, but as they have considerable interest, they will be published in the Report. Dr. Campbell, the American Doctor who was in our service for many years, and who did such excellent work while he was Government Medical Officer of the Interior, found that out of 575 children he examined at six different places in 1931, the majority were physically unfit—a very curious thing amongst a native population. The proportion of physically fit children ranged from 5 per cent, at Patau to 28 per cent, at Tambunan. The proportion infected with latent malaria was in no case less than 56 per cent., and the proportion infected with hookworm was not less than 60 per cent., except in one cp.se, Sensuran village. Dr. Campbell, in analysing the results of his inspections, also wrote that : “with the great influx of Javanese in 1925 to 1927 our type of malaria changed”—from mild benign malaria, to which the Borneo native developed a certain degree of immunity —‘to a virulent and predominating sub-Tertian disseminated by the new Labourers. Then he says : ‘This is one of the probable reasons for our present Interior health dilemma.’ He puts that as one of the probable reasons. The puzzle is win the introduction of the Javanese should have affected the Muruts so much more acutely than the other tribes. "Now I feel that no Shareholder of this Company would ever deny that our first duty as a Company, and as a Sovereign Power, is to safeguard the welfare of the native population. That always has, and always, I am sure, will take precedence over the more material consideration of dividends. It is for that reason that we have suppressed the gambling farm, thereby depriving ourselves of many thousands of pounds of revenue; it is for that reason that we are steadily discouraging the sales of opium; and it is for that reason that, on the recommendation of Mr. Jardine, we have recently authorized the expen¬ diture of a good deal of money upon a scientific research into the health of the remoter native population. We have been fortunate enough to obtain the services of Dr. Shircore, an old colleague of Mr. Jardine’s in East Africa, where he has been responsible for exactly the sort of investigation which we believe we need. He is now in the interior, and with him is Mr. G. C. Woolley, who was for many years a valued servant of the Company and whose knowledge of the native population is unrivalled. It is anticipated that their investigations, which began towards the end of 1935, will take at least a year to complete, and then they will prepare their report. They have this in their favour, that Dr. Dingle and his Staff have by their tact and sympathy through many years, won the complete confidence of the primitive population with the result that there is no reluctance on the part of the natives to submit themselves to examination. Half the battle has been won, and if Dr. Shircore can help us to win the other half we shall be deeply grateful to him and to our Governor. Even on the most material grounds a healthy population is a much more valuable asset than an unhealthy one. "I will now say a few words about the second of our great Industries, namely, Timber. There was a short time, before the days of restriction, when timber was the most valuable export of the country, but those days are gone, and Rubber—even in a bad year like 1935—again occupies the first place. Nearly everyone in this room will, I think, remember that towards the end of 1934 there was a disastrous fire at the Timber Company's yard, which completely burnt out the Mills, Buildings, and everything else. Al one time it was thought possible that output might have to be restricted by as much as 25 per cent. Actually, however, the output of the Timber i Company, apart from its sub-licensees, during 1935, was less than 400,000 cubic feet below that of 1934. For this result great credit must be given to the Management and the employees of the Timber Company. I apeak about the Timber Company for many reasons, but one particularly because it is important for us to note that the principle market for our timber is Japan, which during last year took no less than 49 per cent, of our export. In these days we hear much of cheap Japanese goods exported to other countries. It is well that we should sometimes realize that they, like other people, have their imports. "This brings me to the very flourishing Japanese Fishing Industry, which is established in our waters. This Company now employs over 300 hands and continues to increase its fleet. It is now proposed to export frozen fish in addition to the dried and canned article. Tn this connection it is interesting to note that while the Japanese are responsible for only a quarter of the total export of fish, the value of their trade is nearly two-thirds of the whole. That is due to scientific treatment. “The last Japanese Industry to note is pearl culture on Mabul Island. It seems to be doing fairly well, but, as mentioned last year, the beds are too exposed, and on the advice of a Japanese expert who recently visited the island, they will soon be removed to more sheltered waters where better results are anticipated. Other articles of export which have done well— is you can see from the figures—are Copra, which nearly doubled in value, and firewood. There was also an export of £6,000 worth of Kawang Nuts against nothing in 1934. Another interest, about which I have had several letters, is, the exploration operations conducted by the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company’s Geologists. They have worked over the following twelve separate localities : Padas Gorge, Klias Swamp Basin, Beau¬ fort-Papar-Jesselton, Kudat Peninsula. Bengkoka Peninsula, Labuk Bay, and the Islands of Balam- bangan, Banggi. Malawalli and Jambongan. We shall have to wait, us I told you, some time longer before we have any definite results, but at least exploration has not censed. It will be interesting to you to know that the second stage is just about to be started—that is, the gravity tests. The geological exploration is practically complete, and the gravity tests are now, I am told, about to begin. "I should not like to close these scanty remarks without saying something of the extra strain which has been put upon almost everybody, from His Excellency downwards, by the insufficiency of Rubber quota. It is very aggravating for o people to see their neighbours enjoying more liber treatment than themselves. At times the situation has been strained, if not tense, and but for the ta and patience of the administration, and for the self- control and restraint of our people, things might have been much worse. Let me once more put in a word for our Rubber Controller in his most difficult task.” ‘Apai’: An Appreciation. If sit any time during the past thirty years you had happened to be walking down Island Road, Sibu, at about six in the evening, you might have observed a cloud of smoke advancing rapidly towards you from the direction of the bazaar. On the close approach of this phenomenon your nostrils would have been assailed by the reek of Dusun tobacco, and you would have seen that the smoke-clouds had their origin in the bowl of a pipe which nestled in the middle of an enormous beard. Eventually, when your eyes had successfully pierced the smoke¬ haze, you would have seen that the beard and the pipe were attached to a short and rather burly figure clothed in a white soutane and a scarlet sash; for by now it would have become evident that the prodigy that you had at first taken for a minor upheaval of nature was merely 'Apai' on his way to the Island Club. After a friendly greeting, accompanied by a twinkle from a pair of unusually clear and candid blue eyes, he would have passed on at a sort of quick-step, tapping the gravel with a curly walking stick that would have sent the late Sir Harry Lauder into ecstasies of envy; for Apai, who rarely moved at anything slower than a trot, would to-night have been in even more of a hurry than usual in order to be in time for his bi-weekly game of bowls. Had you chanced to enter the bowling alley a few minutes later, you would have seen Apai, his cassock now thrown aside to reveal a singlet and a pair of slacks, sending the largest balls rolling down the alley with speed and precision. Not even the excitement of the game or the most strenuous physical exertion, however, could induce him to lay aside his formidable pipe, which throughout the evening would continue to emit smoke and sparks to the imminent danger of the surrounding expanse of beard. Why this appendage never caught fire remains an insoluble mystery: certainly its apparent incombustibility was a source of continued wonder to his friends, who were always expecting to hear that the celebrated beaver,’ which was the pride not only of Apai himself, but of the whole of Sibu. had gone up in a sheet of flame. Fortunately tins never happened, and Apai continued to wave lighted matches around the bowl of his pipe with impunity , and to remark with a chuckle that his beard’s non- inflammable qualities might come in useful in a future life. The Island Club was always the brighter for one of Apai's visits, and the affection in which he was held was reflected in the warmth of his wel¬ come; for he was welcome wherever he went.—his exhilarating high spirits and his charm of manner were as refreshing as a burst of sunshine on a dull day. The simile is hackneyed, certainly, but in the case of Father Halder it is difficult to think of one that is more apt. He really was able to impart to others some of the sunshine that shone in his own eternally youthful heart, and to share with them the happiness and enthusiasm that were his in such overflowing measure. He got on with every- one. yet he was in no sense of the word a ‘back- slapper,’ a professional good fellow and mixer; he was utterly free from affectation of any kind, nor was he capable of assuming a geniality that he did not feel- The fact that he was invariably such good company was due simply to his bright and sympathetic nature, and to his genuine delight in the society of his friends. He was never known to say a bitter or an unkind thing about anyone, yet he j had a great sense of humour, and thoroughly appreciated a joke. Apai got a tremendous kick out of life,—no one could be with him for very long without feeling this, and without acquiring some of his own infectious optimism which led him always to make the best of everything, and to laugh at life’s trials and troubles. 1 happened to travel over with him to Singapore last year, and so was able to see something of him in hospital. Apai already had a very good idea of what was wrong with him, but he never allowed the thought of pain, illness and death to damp his spirits for a moment. As he himself remarked— "If my illness is incurable, why, that’s that : I am not afraid to die!” And he refused to allow his friends to worry any more than he did himself. Indeed, he regarded his trip to Singapore more in the light of a holiday than anything else, and enjoyed it thoroughly. Needless to say, he got the most out of each fresh experience, and he was very appreciative of all that was done for him. The ship in which he travelled was the most comfort¬ able vessel on the seven seas, the service was perfect, the food excellent ; the General Hospital, loo, was such a magnificent place that it was a real pleasure to be in it; the doctors were wonder¬ ful, the nurses and attendants miracles of kindness and thoughtfulness. It was all characteristic of Apai. just as it was like him never to complain; I shall never forget his laughter when he described to me an operation which must have been extremely painful. Instead of dwelling on this side of it, however, he turned the whole thing into a joke, and to such good effect that after a few moments 1 was laughing about it too. Father Halder was, I think, the finest character I ever met. It is probably safe to say that during the whole course of his life he never hurt a single person by word or deed. He saw only the best in everyone, and looked always on the brighter side of human nature; for in spite of repeated trials and disappointments he never lost his illusions, or his belief in the innate goodness of mankind. He was big’ in every sense of the word,—his mind was above all pettiness, envy and malice. Apai was deeply religious without being in the least sanctimonious, and it was this, I think, that largely accounted for the respect which he evoked quite unconsciously and without effort in everyone he met; there was a quality of simplicity and quiet sincerity in his way of life that made one love and trust him instantly. After his death, and even during his lifetime, one heard on all sides the term "Saint” applied to him. and who shall say that this was any exaggeration ? If absolute simplicity, purity and honesty, combined with an abundance of human charity and a great capacity for gentle laughter are any qualifications for the title, he most certainly earned it. The Mission at Sibu owes a great debt to his faith and unremitting energy. He was the beloved shepherd of a largo and varied flock, all of whom he knew personally, and to all of whom he was an unfailing source of comfort and strength. In his funeral address Mgr. Hopfgartner remarked that with Father Halder was buried a piece of old Sibu ; this is true, for he was such an essential part of the life of the island that it is almost impossible to imagine it without him. He leaves behind him the fruits of more than thirty years' continuous endeavour, and the work that be accomplished in this period will remain as an enduring memorial to him. He also leaves a gap which cannot be filled, for we. who were privileged to know hirn. know that we shall not easily find such another; we have lost in him a great and good man, and a very charming friend. Why Umio Snores no more. From Our Own Correspondent PT. MORESBY, June 6. The unpleasant habit of snoring was checked rather drastically in Rigo recently, when the deep vibrations of an elderly native, Fania Umio, were unfortunately mistaken for those of a pig, and he was speared to death before the mistake became known. It seems that in a hunt for pigs, one night at Rigo, Umio was charged with guarding the trap while his companions dispersed. The night was dark, and the waiting tedious. Umio’s old bones ached, and soon he was snoring, with grunts so thick and vigorous that no other animal than a pig could produce them. Guided by the sound, the party crept back, and one Tagugaina, stealthily drove his spear home. To his dismay he found later on that the dark form lying dead on the ground was no pig, but his old uncle, Umio ! Tagugaina was charged in the Central Court with murder, hut under the circumstances was found not guilty and discharged. —Pacific Islands Monthly. [The above is an interesting variant of the local trick of one Dayak filling another with buckshot on the same excuse.—ED.] Bligh’s Open Boat Voyage. INTERESTING RELICS IN NEW ZEALAND. Through the cinema, books, and newspaper articles much prominence has been given in recent months to the Bounty mutiny and Captain Bligh's subsequent amazing voyage in an open boat to Timor. The fierce spotlight of publicity bus now uncovered the interesting fact that one of Bligh's grandsons lives at Inglewood, near New Plymouth, in New Zealand. He is Dr. E. S. Nutting, and in his possession are the historic gourd, cup, bullet, and compass used on the epic sea journey after the loyal men had been cast adrift by the mutineers. The gourd from which Bligh ate his allowance of bread and water on the voyage in the Bounty's launch is fashioned from the shell of a coconut. On it are faintly penned the words. “The cup I eat my miserable allowance out of." The small cup made from the horn of some animal measured the water, one gill served to each man three times a day. On the bullet is written, “The bullet, 1-25 of a lb. was the allowance of bread which supported 18 men for 48 days served to each person three times a day.” The compass is that with which the little open boat was steered from Tofua (Tonga) to Timor, 3618 miles. Besides these historic mementoes, Dr. Nutting has a collection of sketches by Captain Bligh. These are artistically and minutely drawn. —Pacific Islands Monthly Public Enemy. Q. And now, Mr. Gooch, please tell the court your occupation. A. Well, sir, I suppose you might call me a whistle-imitator. Q. You mean you go around sounding like steamboats and railroad trains? A. Naw, that there is kid stuff! What I do is whistle the same stuff that other people is whistling. Q. I'm afraid 1 don't understand. Mr. Gooch. A. Well, like for instance, supposing yon was in an elevator somewhere and you was whistling softly some tune like “Red Sails in the Sunset." Well, I get into the elevator and I start whistling “Red Sails in the Sunset" too. Q. Is that all there is to it? A. Oh, no. I generally whistle it a little faster than you do and I also whistle pretty loud. Q. So that I have to make up my mind whether to whistle as fast as you are or stop whistling altogether. Is that it ? , A. Well, yes. And if you start to whistle as fast as I do. why then I simply change the key on you. Q. It sounds like fascinating work. A. Yes, sir! I never will forget the day about three years ago when I caught Gatti-Casazza com¬ ing out of the Metropolitan Opera House whistling the Soldiers' Chorus from Faust. Q. What did you do? A. Woll, sir, I fell in behind him and I starts to whistle the Soldiers’ Chorus, too, only I changed the key on him. Left him high and dry, I did ! Q. And then what did he do? A. He stopped whistling. Q. I don't suppose you get many opportunities like that one ! A. Oh. I don't know. I get a chance at nearly every Bing Crosby picture. I’m usually whistling pretty well into the second chorus by the time he’s winding up the first. Q. Tell me. Mr. Gooch, what do you do in the evening for recreation? A. Well. I generally sit and play the radio loud so the people downstairs will telephone up. but sometimes I go out visiting and play other people's radios so loud that nobody can hear what anybody is saying. Q. And what does your wife think of all this? A. She ain't got much time to think on account of she is pretty busy with her own work. Q. What does Mrs. Gooch do? A. She writes funny stuff in the margins of public library books. like “Turn to for some hot stuff!" Q. Well, this has been very illuminating, Mr. Gooch, and I want to thank you. A. Can I go now? I've got a date to meet the wife at the Bijou theatre. We’re going in and spend the afternoon beating time on the backs of seats.—DOUG WELCH in Judge. Films of the Month. The month opened at the Sylvia Cinema with I Cecil de Mille’s ‘Mightiest Production,’ The Crusades, an unbelievably silly and vulgar historical travesty in which we were once again treated to display of the De Mille obsession which can bes be described as Stupendomania. This director relies on mass effects in the hope that they will stun his audiences and blind them to his complete lack of taste, imagination, and any kind of artistic sense; he strives to overwhelm us with bigness, and so leave us gasping “ What a film!".—for to producers of his type an exclamation such as this repeated rapturously by several million morons spells Success with a capital 'S.' So long as thousands of horsemen gallop madly across vast expanses of country to take part in terrific battles under the walls of gigantic castles, so long as fire and boiling oil are mined upon hundreds of massed human beings; so long as there is a plethora of armour, spears, tapestries, engines of war and perky blondes with enamelled faces and tough Middle West accents dressed in mediaeval costumes, why. that is all that is needed : the film is bound to be a riot, and in view of the present level of public taste. it usually is. Here we had the mixture as before, and since it played to packed audiences most of whom remained in their seats until the bitter end. it must have had something to recommend it. A very different kind of entertainment was Friday The 13th, a British picture with an all-star cast that showed us just what British producers can do when they really try. This was a splendid film, beauti¬ fully produced and photograped. well acted, and with a plot that held one’s attention all the time. The story followed the 'Bridge of San Luis Rey’ formula; six people were shown in a London bus just before it met with an accident,—the film then switched back to tell us through a series of episodes just why those people happened to be in that parti¬ cular bus. and what effect the, accident had on their lives, and on the lives of others. These episodes were brilliantly interwoven into a story that had all the necessary qualities of pathos, humour and excite¬ ment. The production, too, reached a high level of competence,—there was no trace of the amateurish¬ ness from which so many British films suffer. Emlyn Williams was excellent, as the blackmailer, and Max Miller gave a delightful study of a cheap¬ jack salesman from the Caledonian market. But indeed, all the players were good, though this, after all. was only to be expected in a cast, that included Sonny Hale. Frank Lawton. Edmund Gwenn, Gordon Harker, Robertson Hare. Jessie Matthews (what a lovely creature she is!) and Martita Hunt. A memorable picture. If only British films would maintain this tech¬ nical and artistic level, they would have no reason to fear competition from Hollywood. Listen to what a celebrated American film critic wrote quite recently :— “There is no reason why the English should not eventually lead the world in the motion picture manufacturing business They have the best of all writers and actors, they understand pageantry and circus better than any other nation because the British Empire itself is built on pageantry and circus, they know more about bamboozling and satisfying savages than any other Government. “They are still frequently amateurish in the technique of the cinema, but they may in time bungle through to perfection in that direction.” The sooner we ‘bungle through' and improve our technique the better for the British film industry,— and, incidentally, for the film public. Over The Garden Wall, with Bobby Howes and Marian Marsh, was an embodiment of all the faults which make one stay away from British films : a dull story, dull dialogue, uninspiring tunes and incredibly amateurish production. It was simply a second-rate musical comedy transferred bodily to the screen without modification. When will British producers realise that one simply cannot apply the same technique to the stage and the screen ’. This criticism applies also to A Cup Of Kindness (the usual Tom Wall—Ralph Lynn— Robertson Hare mixture) in which good material was spoilt for the same reason. We're In The Money was a delightful comedy with a highly original plot and some sublime lunacy on the part of Hugh Herbert. Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell were admirably cast as the two hard-boiled little process-servers whose adventures made up a first-rate film,—slick, funny, and con¬ vincing. Hugh Herbert, incidentally, is one of the very few really funny comedians at present on the screen. Among the others are Charlie Ruggles, whose clever fooling redeemed a wildly extravagant plot in Murder On The Runaway Train, and Stan Laurel, who was at his best in The Bohemian Girl, a picture which gave him and Oliver Hardy a chance for some admirable clowning. At their best, these two comedians can he very good indeed, and The Bohemian Girl was a riot of laughter all the way through. Peg Of Old Drury, starring Anna Neagle and Sir Cedric Hardwicke, was another first-rate British production, though the design of the film bore a suspicious resemblance to Nell Gwynn, in which these two stars scored a notable success some time ago. But the acting and photography were so out¬ standingly good that we didn’t mind. Thanks A Million, with Dick Powell and Ann Dvorak, was good Saturday night entertainment. First Division News. JULY. Forty-six civil and sixty criminal cases came before the Kuching courts during July. On July 6th at an inquest into the death of a Kheh Chinese, named Jong Fook, a verdict of death from misadventure was returned. Deceased was one of the coolies employed on the excavations that are taking place at the landing¬ ground at the 7th mile, lie was killed instantaneously by a heavy fall of earth while engaged in levelling an embankment. The District Officer, Kuching, paid a routine visit to Lundu, Simatan and Telok Serabang during the month. It is gratifying to be able to report that the Kampong bridge at Santubong is nearing com¬ pletion. In December, 1934, orders were given that this bridge should be reconstructed without delay. Owing, however, to the fact that the village has been divided against itself for a con¬ siderable time, and to the fact that the Tua Kampong found himself incompetent to deal with the trouble, little or no progress was made in the re-erection of the bridge. The Datu Hakim visited Dayak villages at Git, Nyiru, Landeh, Sigo and Tamato to distribute notices announcing the forthcoming Tapping Holiday, and to attend to any other matters brought up for discussion. During the course of his visit he was approached by inhabitants of Kampong Sentah and Sekrak with regard to the petition recently submitted requesting the rein¬ statement of Tua Kampong James as Ketua'an Orang Kaya. The Datu Bentara visited Santubong, Buntal, Bako, Muara Tebas, Sambir, Temberat, Setekan, Stampin, Merdang Gayam, Bayor, Sungei Plai'i and Tabuan. Notices announcing the forthcom¬ ing tapping holiday were distributed. Several Chinese have recently submitted appli¬ cations to erect shophouses at various places up river and on July 3rd, accompanied by Mr. J. L. Noakes, Assistant Superintendent of Lands and Surveys, the District Officer proceeded by launch to Sungei Tapang to inspect the sites men¬ tioned in the applications. No fewer than eleven shops were found between Batu Kawa and Sungei Tapang, and of these five are scattered about in garden? in the immediate vicinity of the Dayak village at Tamato. As it is undesirable for these shops to remain on their present sites, the Acting Resident, the District Officer, Kuching, the District Officer, Ban, and the Assistant Superintendent of Lands and Surveys visited Batu Kitang arid Kranji on July 10th, with a view to selecting a suitable site for a bazaar area. H.M.S Herald, under the command of Com¬ mander N. A. C. Hardy R.N., anchored at Pending on July 17th, and left on the 20th. Entertainments arranged for the ship’s company included hockey, football and cricket matches against Kuching teams. At Bau an inquest was held on the body of a Chinese named Chong Shui, who was reported to have met his death by drowning in a pond at the Bau Gold Mining Syndicate on July 28th. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned. 872 persons were treated at Bau Government Dispensary during July, and 75 N.A.B. injections were given. The Dresser-in-Charge visited the Left-Hand Branch, where 999 persons were treated during the trip and 25 N.A.B. injections were performed. A drain has been constructed behind the Junior Staff quarters near the Bau Court-house in order to drain the swamp area there, which is a bad breeding-place for mosquitoes. The swamp near the Police barracks has also been drained for the same reason. A Land Dayak of Kampong Gumbang, Nga- wai by name, reported on the 19th that while out pig-shooting that morning he had shot a relation of his. It appeared that the shooting had taken place in N.E.I. territory, and the local Courts having no jursidiction. the Dutch authorities were informed. — Dahan Rubber estates harvested 19,800 lbs. dry rubber during July. Rainfall at Bau was 5.54 inches, and at Dahan 4.54 inches. The District Officer reports that the supply of fresh vegetables from the Prison Garden at Bau exceeds the demand, and surplus vegetables are being sold to Government servants. Although no new companies came into being during the month, prospecting continues at a steady pace. The S'buran Gold Mine created something of a record during the month by obtaining 354.64 fine ounces of gold from 174 tons of ore. The average, price of gold for the month of June was $58.38. Royalty paid amounted to $12,336.48. The following table gives the individual output of gold for June, 1936, by the various mining companies operating in Upper Sarawak :— The Native Officer, Lundu, mentions in his report that the Dayak village at Pueh is now fairly clean, since all the inhabitants have removed their pigs, which were formerly fed underneath their houses, into newly-constructed styes. This must be a welcome innovation. 5,000 pikuls of tengar bark were shipped from the Lundu district to Selalang by m.v. Masnona and Sidney R. Maw during the month. On July 11th Mr. G. F. J. Pegler, District Officer, accompanied by Mr. N. E. Hughes arrived at Lundu by m.l. Lucile. The former stayed at the station until the 14th when he proceeded on patrol duty along the coast between Cape Datu and Santubong, and the latter left for Talang Talang the following day. They returned again on the 16th. The following are extracts from a report by Abang Zambari, Native Officer. Lundu :— I left on a Dayak tour on July 27th, accom- . panied by Abang Sulaiman, Probationary Native Officer. We travelled overland as far as Biawak. It appears that no improvements in the conditions of the Beduan and Pasir Ulu long houses have been made since my last visit to these kampongs, and in spite of better con¬ ditions these people take little or no interest in kampong affairs. "Pengarah Kusoi informed me that the inhabitants of Pasir Ilir and Kanda-ee intend to erect long-houses immediately after the harvest, but eight doors, which are part of the intended long-house, have already been erected. "The usual lecture on rubber restriction, tuba fishing and general adat was given at each house visited, and all outstanding cases were settled "A meeting regarding the construction of a bridge over Sungei Belinsah was held between Pueh Dayaks and Telok Serabang people, and they appear agreeable to have it erected before the landas. The construction will commence on August 1st. "At Telok Serabang the kampong was quiet as most of the people were still away fishing somewhere in the vicinity of Cape Datu and Telok Melanau. In view of- the fair weather, good catches are be expected. "Reports were continually received from Malays and Chinese of Telok Serabang that much of their coconut and vegetable gardens have been spoilt by monkeys and wild pigs which are exceptionally numerous in this part of the country this year." The District Officer, Samarahan and Serian, reports that during the month the down river Malay kampong at Serian was demarcated and an up river site for another kampong was proposed and cleared preparatory to survey. Dayak Tax at Serian has nearly all been paid, though there are still a few defaulters in the Samarahan. Boundary disputes amongst the Land Dayaks in the Serian District are becoming excessive. During the District Officer’s visit to the Ulu Sadong this month he heard preliminary enquiries into the following boundary disputes : Tebeduk vs. Tomah; Meringgu vs. Koran; S’binting vs. Semabang; Mentu vs. Mentong; Mentu vs. Mayang; Bidak vs. Taup. The people from each kampong have been instructed to cut a rentis where they think the boundary should be, and the disputants have also been told that unless they can arrange mutual boundaries and have them registered in the Serian Offices, both parties will be called upon to deposit $15 towards the cost of a survey. Old records will be examined and each case settled and then application made to the Land and Survey Department for demarcation with concrete marks. Land in the half-mile reserve along the Serian- Tebekang Road was thrown open to alienation on July 15th and by the end of the month about 35 applications had been received. A survey of all the land from the 88th Mile to Serian was completed on July 16th The Director of Public Works visited Serian on July 6th and decided to lower the level of the Kuching Bond in front of the bazaar to the level of the new shop-houses, and to use the earth and stones thus obtained for filling at the back of the bazaar. The Principal Medical Officer accom¬ panied the Director of Public Works and agreed that the filling in at the back of the bazaar was a matter of urgency if the back premises are not to become both dangerous and insanitary. The water supply for Serian was examined by the Principal Medical Officer and Director of Public Works who were both of the opinion that the present supply (Sungei Serian) was totally in¬ adequate and highly insanitary. It was proposed that water should he brought from Sungei Ranchang or Sungei Kranji on the Smuja moun¬ tain. and this would mean laying down a pipe-lino some 2 1/2 miles in length. Further details are required by the Director of Public Works and so a census of the population in Serian is being taken and a rentis is being cut direct to Sungei Ranchang. The following are extracts from a report by the District Officer, Samarahan and Serian, on a trip to the Ulu With Native Officer Abang Samsudin, and Native Officer Abang Latip, I visited the Ulu Sadong from 14th to 28th. All villages which were visited (88 in all) bad been cleaned and nearly all those who bad been ordered to build new houses had done so and had built a very much better type of house than the Land Dayak usually docs. If a policy of gentle persuasion is continued, the Land Dayaks will soon learn to take a pride in their villages. From the few villages who had disobeyed the order to build new houses (Mongkos, Plaman Lobang Batu, Slabi) 1 took pledges of gongs. "Besides six boundary disputes there were no cases of importance—Orang Kaya Akoi of Temah accompanied me part of the way and I think he would do well as an Orang Kaya Temonggong. Four new Pengarahs and Penglimas were elected at various villages to replace officials who have died, but I am not replacing any Orang Kayas until it has been decided whether the Land Dayaks are going to be administered through an Orang Kaya Temonggong of the District, or through Orang Kayas of each village. "The Dresser visited the left-hand branch of the Ulu Sadong with me and gave injections and did some vaccinating." The District Officer states that Serian as the centre of the Sadong and Samarahan districts is becoming a very busy centre, and it would not be surprising if shortly two Europeans are found to be necessary, especially if the regular travelling in the Ulu Sadong and Samarahan is to be kept up. NOTE. The Superintendents of Lands and Surveys points out that the paragraph on Moyan land affairs which appeared on page 189) of the last issue of the conveys a wrong impression of what took place, and comments as follows — “There was no question of other people being given title to the land—the alternative to the occupier taking out title was that the land would become communal reserve. Such a communal reserve would be common to member of that kampong or house and would be administered by the Tua Kampong or Tuai Rumah. No rent is payable on such Communal Reserves. “The impression created by your further statement, anent the natives already having large debts tv Government, for quit rent is also perhaps somewhat misleading as the majority of natives in that urea do not possess titles and have not been called on to pay quit rent. “4s the first is rather a fundamental difference and your paragraph might give rise to an unfortunate impression I would be glad if you would make the matter dear in your next issue." St. Thomas’ School. JUBILEE MEMORIAL FUND. The response to the appeal published in the May issue of the has been encouraging, About 260 ‘Old Boys’ and friends of the school have bribed or promised $3,411.13 up to and includ- ing 22nd August, 1936. This sum lulls short of what we hoped to collect, but there must be many past members and friends of the school who have not yet sent in donations and who will wish to do so. A further sum of $11,589 is still needed to reach the total aimed at. It will be remembered that our aim is to raise sufficient money to establish a Bursary Fund to enable some worthy children of poor parentage to receive education when they cannot afford to pay fees. If the total of $15,000 is collected a portion would go towards the erection of a Grand Stand on the Playing Fields or a School library either of which would sene as a fitting memorial of the Jubilee. It is with very many thanks that the Committee acknowledge the following donations which have been paid or promised :— Sarawak Turf Club.

On July 21st an inquest was held at Lingga by the Native Officer on the body of Chang Phai, a trader, who was drowned at Nanga Tatai. It appears that the rope supporting the oar of his trading boat broke while Chang Phai was rowing, and thereby threw him into the water. He was unable to swim, as also were the other persons in the boat. A verdict of death by misadventure was recorded. On July 4th Dresser Sulieman arrived at Lingga from Kuching and proceeded to the ulu to perform vaccinations. This work was completed on the 19th. 119 patients were treated at Simanggang Government dispensary during the month, and 55 N.A.B. injections were performed. The health of the district was good. On July 8th flags throughout the Second Division were half-masted on hearing the sad news of Mr. F. A. W. Page-Turner's death. — Reports from Skrang indicate an excellent harvest, except in the extreme ulu, where crops are moderate. The District Officer, Simanggang, visited the experimental demonstration vegetable garden at N. Enteban on June 27th. Below is an extract from a report by Mr. W. P. N. L. Ditmas, Acting District Officer. Simanggang, on a visit to the Ulu Skrang :— "The following may be of interest, and was told me when I visited R. Unting. "The old house had been burnt down about a year ago, and I happened to notice and remark that there seemed to be no old dogs in the new house. I was told that when a house is accidentally destroyed by fire it is the adat that none of the surviving animals may be kept. Pigs and fowls must be either eaten or sold, and since other Dayaks will not buy dogs, they have to be destroyed. In this case the dogs were all drowned by having stones tied to their necks. All the cats in the house were burnt as they ran straight to the sadau (loft) when the house took fire. 'T understand that this custom is unknown amongst most Dayaks, but that it is practised by Skrang and Kanowit people. Mr. G. R. H. Arundell, District Officer, Lubok Antu, has made inquiries and informs me that this custom is known in the extreme Ulu Ai, and is only practised when a house has been burnt down by the enemy and members of the house killed. The domestic animals are then killed to prevent them disturbing and eating corpses. "Another point which may be of interest is that before, and particularly during, this visit, 1 noticed that the Skrangs use the word Iban to mean men or people (mensia), and not necessarily Sea Dayaks, whom they usually refer to as ‘Dayak.’ As a tribe they refer to themselves as ‘kami Skrang.’ It is possible that this use of Iban may be comparatively a new custom.” On July 18th a Chinese dinner and a Malay curry were provided in the Simanggang Recreation Club as a farewell to Mr. Eng Yaw Huat, Chief Treasury Clerk, who has resigned from the Service, and who has for some time been Hon. Secretary and Treasurer of the Club. At the close of the dinner an inscribed silver cigarette case from the members of the Club was presented to him. On July 7th Dayaks brought in a 13 feet 7 inches crocodile which they had caught at Nanga Skrang. The District Officer, Betong, reports that police patrols paid several visits to the Layar and Spak in in the course of their investigation of the Temagun murder; unfortunately no fresh clues were dis¬ covered. As a result of Government’s prompt action in demolishing certain scattered dampas in the ulu Spak, it is reported that nearly all ulu Dayaks hate now returned to their long-houses. This should facilitate administration, discourage future rebel activities, and generally restore confidence in the ulu. It is pleasing to note that Government's object was attained without undue severity and without en¬ countering active opposition, and has met with the approval of the majority of the Saribas Dayaks. The District Officer hopes to revisit the ulu next month when a more comprehensive survey can he made of the position. Tn the meantime inmates of a long-house at S. Klanpai have been ordered to return to N. Tiga, which they left contrary to orders two years ago. Difficulty may be experienced in enforcing this order, but it is not proposed to take definite action until after the next harvest. A similar order has been given to a two-doored house in the Penebak. On July 16th Jeluieng, an outlaw wanted by the authorities in the Third Division, surrendered at S. Amu Layar. He was escorted to Betong where he was remanded until his departure for Kuching under escort on the 27th. Tn several districts at Saribas natives have com¬ menced clearing the land for next year’s crops. : Efforts are being made to encourage the natives to plant early, but it is unlikely that these will meet with any appreciable success. The importance of planting sufficient root crops has been pointed out to the Dayaks. Jeti, who was remanded on a charge of murder, escaped from Betong prison in the early hours of the morning of the 21st; he was recaptured by Selulap Dayaks the following morning. As a result of this escape three constables were prosecuted under section 223 of the Penal Code. Previous to his escape Jeti is alleged to have attempted suicide on two occasions. On the mornings of July 25th and 26th a Regatta was held in Betong, while land sports and foothall took place in the afternoon. Entries for all events exceeded expectations, and a very large crowd wit¬ nessed the proceedings. The festivities were greatly enlivened by the presence of the Kuching Military Band whose masterly performance won well-deserved applause. The Resident, Second Division, very kindly presented the Regatta prizes while Abang Draup, Native Officer, assisted by handing out the land sport prizes, together with a football cup which he himself had presented. At Roban several cases of working belian without licences were reported by the Forest Guard, the persons concerned were fined; one case was adjourned for the Forest Officer at Sibu to make enquiries; the Dayaks concerned were found to he felling belian wholesale in the ulu Roban. and taking it to the Island Trading Company at Selalang. During the month the Dresser-in-Charge, Kalaka, was sent round to visit all substations in the district including Dayak houses in the ulu Roban and Nyabore. He reported a considerable number of people were suffering from influenza, and vaccinated about two hundred persons. The Malay kampong at Nyabore he considered very unhealthy and over¬ grown. The Malays have been ordered to clean up the kampong. Native Officer Abang Bujang, of Kabong, reports that on July 30th Mr. W. H. Kelley, Assistant Commissioner of Sarawak Constabulary, accom¬ panied by two detectives, arrived in the m.l. Lucile to investigate the disappearance of fishing nets belonging to Chinese off Puloh Burong. Two Malays were found in possession of some of these nets which they stated they found in the sea. Mr. Kelley left the next day for Pusa. Betong Regatta, 1936. A very successful Regatta was held at Betong on Saturday July 25th and Sunday 26th under the patronage of the Resident, Second Division. The Regatta was held on two mornings instead of on the morning and afternoon of one day so that the same course could be followed throughout independently of the whims of the tide. On the first day the three heats in the fifteen-men boats were decided, the flag-bearer of one of the winners having announced beforehand that he was certain of victory on the strength of a dream he had had the night before. It seems that in this dream H.H. the Rajah appeared before him and wished him the best of luck. After the race, curiously enough, the other competitors did not demand the return of their entrance fees. On the second dav the 15 Championship was won by Braok with his boat Sri Kilat Terbang. The fifteen¬ men Consolation Race had to be paddled twice as the result of a more or less unanimous foul at the first attempt. On the Saturday afternoon the final of a boys football competition was played between the Mission School and the Malay School. The former won by two goals to nil. On the Sunday afternoon land sports were held on the Padang. These were excellently organised by Dresser Haji Su’ut and Native Officer Abang Draup. They concluded with a tug-of-war between a team of four Europeans, three Penghulus, one Native Officer, one launch engineer and one police-sergeant, and a team of ten local Malays. The latter pulled the former over with ignominy almost before they had grasped the rope. Lastly, mention must be made of the entertain¬ ment rendered by the Kuching Military Band. These gentlemen tootled and thumped with enthu¬ siasm and energy throughout the heat of the day, and always drew a large crowd. The Regatta Committee is particularly to be congratulated on its enterprise in making the necessary arrangements with the Constabulary authorities, and generally on the provision of a most enjoyable week-end. —K.H.D. Third Division News. JULY. Twenty-nine civil and thirty-four criminal cases came before the Sibu Courts during July. On the 8th a Henghua Chinese named Eck Ah Sui was found guilty on a charge of murder and sentenced to death. Hie Highness the Tuan Muda was pleased to exercise his prerogative of mercy, however, and sentence of death was commuted to one of fifteen years’ imprisonment. A case of voluntarily causing grievous hurt against two Foochow Chinese was dismissed, and the accused acquitted, owing to insufficient evidence. The body of a male Chinese child aged eight was found on Pulo Dudong by a party of Dyaks. The body was brought to Sibu where it was identified, and at the subsequent inquest a verdict of death by accidental drowning was returned. The total land revenue for the Third Division for June amounted to $25,369.06 as compared with $20,953.87 for the corresponding month of the previous year. The collection for Sibu district for the month amounted to $4,649.33 shewing a decrease of approximately $12,000 as compared with the previous month, and approximately $7,000 compared with the corresponding month of the previous year. The large decrease in revenue, it is considered, is mainly due to gardeners being too busy tapping rubber to attend office. It is noticeable that the revenue collection appears to increase during the tapping holiday and to decrease during the tapping period. Mr. C. E. J. Pascoe, Superintendent of Rubber Restriction, visited Sibu from July 29th to 30th, when various matters were discussed, chiefly in connection with the prevention of export of under- smoked and wet rubber. During the month twenty-six new applications for Rubber Exporter’s Licences were approved, and the stock allowances of existing exporters were adjusted with the actual amount of rubber exported by each during the past six months. It was found in the majority of cases that the original stock allowances were too high, although the figures available included the exports of scrap rubber earlier in the year. A number of Sibu exporters deal exclusively in rubber scrap, and are now not exporting anything. This will involve a fresh re-adjustment of all stock allowances in two months’ time. Arrangements were made to increase the staff of local Rubber Restriction Inspectors in order to cope with large numbers of applications to replant. The following are the Sibu and Kanowit trade statistics for the month :— Rubber exports from the Division Chinese gardeners from Engkilo complained that the dumping of bazaar refuse was affecting their water supply. This has been attended to, and all garbages now dumped further down river. Owing to the lack of rain there was a serious shortage of water at Sarikei. M.L. Wullie was used during the month for transporting water to this station. The District Officer, Sibu, reports with regret that on July 11th at about 2.50 p.m. Inspector Mohd. Yan died in hospital. His body was re¬ moved to Data Abang Haji Mohidin's house, and on the 12th at 10.30 a.m. the funeral took place. Among those present were the Officer Superintend¬ ing Sibu Constabulary Sector, Mr. W. L. P. Sochon, Senior Inspector Abang Adeng and a number of members of the Constabulary and representatives of other Services. The total rainfall for the month was 7.95 inches. On the whole July in Sibu was a dry month. Although fifteen wet days were recorded the rain was slight, and only on two occasions did the rain¬ fall approach the two-inch mark. A mosquito survey of Meluan station area was carried out during the month. This work was done by the Sanitary Inspector from Kuching under the supervision of the Assistant Health Officer. Early in July a meeting was held of the leading members of the Chinese and Malay communities to discuss the advisability, or otherwise, of organising a regatta at the end of the year. Backed by the approval of the Resident, it was decided unanimously that, taking into considera¬ tion the comparative prosperity now enjoyed by all communities, the time had come when it would be justifiable to stage an event that might be enjoyed by all communities throughout the Divi¬ sion. A Committee was formed and arrangements are being made to hold the regatta on Friday, January 1st. 1937, and land sports on Saturday. January 2nd. A Malay employee of the Island Trading Company, at Selalang, was admitted to the Sibu Hospital with damaged fingers. This employee, Suriji bin Aron, admitted that he had met with the accident through his own carefessness while oiling machinery. He attached no blame what¬ soever to his employers. Native Officer F. Ansin made a tour of inspec¬ tion of Penghulu Imai's district, leaving Sibu on the 24th and returning on the 31st. A detailed map showing all Dayak districts is being made; this includes the whereabouts of all Dayak houses and the number of doors to each house. Mr. N. A. Middleman, Superintendent of Lands and Surveys, arrived from Mukah and Oya districts on the 8th. Mr. C. S. Sergel of the same depart¬ ment also arrived and proceeded to Kanowit to carry out survey work. The District Officer. Lower Rejang, reports there was no serious crime in his district during July. A few offences against opium and rubber restriction regulations were dealt with by the Courts. Clearing and burning their farms kept the Lower Rejang Dayaks busy during the month. Abang Openg, Native Officer, acting for the District Officer, met the Travelling District Officer in the Julau, to discuss district and Penghulus’ boun¬ daries ; all Penghulus affected were present at the meeting. It was provisionally decided to give part of Penghulu Nyambar's district to Penghulu Umpor, and to extend the Lower Rejang boundary to include the Sugai Dayaks. White pepper is coming out into the Sarikei and Binatang bazaars in good quantities. The quality is very poor, however, and the price discouraging. The Agricultural Inspector continued his visits to the pepper areas. Some very good pepper land has been found in the Meradu, where gardens are producing 3 1/2 katis per vine. Seventy katis of vegetables were taken from Sarikei vegetable garden for prison consumption during the month. The repairing of Jakar road was completed during the month, and 7 1/2 miles is now open to motor traffic. The Bulat will have to remain closed until it has been metalled. A contract was signed for the delivery of 100 yards of gravel at the junction of the Jakar and Bulat roads. On July 21st or 22nd $815.00 was stolen from the safe in Song Government Office. Investiga¬ tions were made, but so far no charge has been preferred against anyone. Enquiries are con¬ tinuing. Most of the Dayaks in the Kapit district have finished felling and are waiting for a burn; un¬ fortunately continual rain has prevented this and the Dayaks are. beginning to express anxiety over the lack of burning weather. Many of the Kayans have had an early burn before the present wet spell. During the month an extraordinary number of hamadryads were killed at Kapit. A Chinese prisoner serving a sentence of nine months for selling spurious medicines and charms to Dayaks was bitten by one of these creatures while endea¬ vouring to demonstrate the potency of his charms; Ins fellow-prisoners exhorted him to complete his demonstration, but only the timely arrival of the Dresser saved his life, and he was sent to Sibu for further treatment. The prisoners nt Kapit regard this affair as one of the best jokes they have had for years. Below are extracts from a report by the Distr Officer, Kapit, on a tour of the Belaga area :— “I left Kapit on June 4th in the Sri Kapit accompanied by Mr. Spurway, Divisional Forest Officer, N.O. Abang Ahmat. Penghulu Sibat, the Dresser, and two police. The forest staff pro¬ ceeded in an outboard hired from the bazaar. "The Pelagus rapids were difficult owing to very low water, which of course is as bad as high water for travelling. Dayaks and Bukitans were waiting at Wong Embawang to help in the portages. Owing to the amount of barang taken by the Forest Department, the hired outboard had to return for a second load from Kapit. “Portages were necessary at Embawang, Sukat, Kara and Marum. but Matup was negotiated without one. Owing to the fact that much barang had to be transported as well as two boats, we were unable to reach the head of the rapids and spent the night on the rocks at the foot of Wong Lungga. "On the 5th, by 11.30 a.m. we cleared the rapids after another portage. On reaching Nanga Dap some of the heavier barang was left for a return trip of the hired outboard from Belaga. The night was spent at Rumah Saba, Nanga Pila; judging by some coffee growing here the land must be very fertile, and appears to be mainly alluvial silt. “On the 6th proceeded up to Nanga Bah where we picked up Penghulu Puso, and then to the Punan Biaw at Nanga Sama; these houses I left to be visited on my return trip. “1 arrived at Belaga at 8.30 a.m. on the 7th. Penghulu Taman Usun Hang had arrived the previous day, and the bazaar was fairly full. Various collections of revenue were made after the process of settling in had been completed. In the evening both Penghulus and most of the leading Kayans came up to the Fort to discuss matters at large. “On the 8th the Kubu was crowded all day and work was commenced on clearing the Govern¬ ment padang. The erection of a new bridge between the bazaar and Kampong was also started: I brought the prison carpenter from Kapit to do this, and also to effect the necessary repairs to the Government buildings. "In the evening an aum was held in the Kubu attended by both Penghulus. twenty-one heads of houses, and many other tuai. Numerous questions were discussed and such subjects as rubber restriction, forest reserves, padi farm¬ ing, opening of appeals, medical treatment and general relations with the Dayaks were dealt with at some length. As usual, everyone wished to plant rubber. A unanimous request was made for Government to grant an injured party’s share in such cases as Berangkat, Butang and Tunggu Tinggal, there being no injured party's share at present in these fines. Tn my opinion this probably is partly the cause of the unwel¬ come increase in the number of such cases hushed up in the house by mutual agreement, the offender paying compensation to the injured party but inclining no Government fine; naturally such cases on coming to light have been severely dealt with, and the head of the house fined, but the increase is unwelcome from the Government point of view. “After the aum a main was held which con¬ tinued well into the early hours of the morning. "The 9th and 10th were spent in collecting revenue and hearing various cases. “On the 11th I left for Uta Baloi accompanied by Mr. Spurway, calling at Uma Agoing, Uma Kahei, Uma Nyagu (Kejaman) and Uma Aki Tuba (Kejaman) where lunch was taken. All these houses have large debts to Kapit towkays, and now that jungle produce has little price th y appear to be making not the slightest effort to pay anything. “Leaving Uma Apan on 12th we passed Nanga Mejawa and negotiated Wong Kutau and Wong Bakun with a portage occupying consider¬ able time. Passing Wong Bayong Nanga Belepeh and Giam Daha I visited Uma Nyabeng (Long Brahan) and then proceeded up the Baloi to Uma Belur, Uma Kelap, and Uma Lahanan Nanga Pangai, where, the night was spent. There have been many deaths in this house, which is to move a short distance downstream next year. The deaths are all attributed to non- observance of i bad bird-omen about three years ago. “Heavy rain occurred during the night of the 15th and the river began to rise. In the evening I met some of the Punan Tallin ; the Kayans complained of persistent thieving by Ukits of vegetables and fruit, but were unable to prove anything; 1 know that the Kayans would be delighted to have the Ukits moved from what is undoubtedly a very fertile area of ground. “I proceeded downstream on the 16th, leaving Mr. Spurway in the Penghulu's house unable to proceed upstream owing to high water. Calling at Uma Kelap and Uma Belur I spent the night at Long Brahan Uma Nyabeng. “From the 21st to 25th was spent in collect¬ ing revenue and settling cases in Belaga. A notice was published warning the bazaar that any Chinese allowing a native to gamble with him in the bazaar would be prosecuted. It is astonishing how the Kayan is swindled by the Chinese over the bartering of mats, etc.,—just as the Punan is treated by the Kayan and Dayak. In view of the large number of good quality mats made in this district I suggest that some sort of co-operative selling might he adopted under Government supervision; it seems to be going too far when a mat which if sold by auction in Kapit would bring about $5 is purchased by the Chinese or Malays in Belaga for a sarong and a little soap worth about $1. If the mats could he sold in Kuching, no doubt a much higher price would be realised than in Kapit. Jungle produce having no price, the Kayan is hard put to it to make money, and if a steady trade in mats could be organised he would benefit considerably. In view of the ex¬ tortionate profit made by the Chinese and Malays I do not think Government could be accused of interfering without reason. “On the 27th after passing Giam Sah and Giam Supan I reached Uma Oyong Tugang for lunch. A long portage at Wong Urek was made and the night was spent in a temporary langkau we made at Losong Ulaw, the head of the rapids. 1 sprained my ankle badly here but luckily just at the end of the portage, and found myself only able to hobble even with the aid of sticks. “After paddling and poling all day we reached Uma Badang on 30th. These people have pulled down their old dwelling on account of deaths, and expect to build again next year just behind the old site. “On July 1st I continued up to Pala Menoa Uma Bawa for the night. An aum was held concerning Sungei Belaga affairs with all the Tuai Rumah who had accompanied me up-river. “On July 2nd I proceeded down to Uma Bamali for the night; this is a bad house, but the inhabitants are making a valiant effort to throw off their hereditary Punan habits in favour of Kenyah ideas. “There are immense quantities of belian in the Sungei Belaga, but the long continuous rapids unfortunately prevent it being brought down. “The 7th and 8th were spent in Belaga receiving revenue and settling cases. “I received a report from Baloi people which was confirmed by Penghulu Tama Usun Hang that Dayaks ordered to return home by Mr. Hidden were still in the Ulu Linau near the Punan Busang, and had started to farm. Apparently they “have accumulated large quantities of damar and a large number of mats obtained by trading tobacco, cloth, etc., with the Punans: in fact they have collected practi¬ cally all such mats, with the result that most of the Punans have none with which to pay their tax this vear. I have sent Penghulu Sibat, who fortunately was with Mr. Hudden when the Dayaks were ordered to return, to bring down these Dayaks who will be dealt with in Kapit. As they are about six days up the Linau it would have been impossible to wait for them at Belaga. "On the 10th I proceeded down to Uma Balo Kasieng; a new house is being built to replace the old one destroyed by floods. From here I visited Uma Tainan Guru ; in this house there is a turbulent and quarrelsome element beaded by Taman Aloi who aspires to be Tuai Rumah; measures were taken to eradicate this trouble. We reached Belaga at 5 p.m. Owing to two days continuous heavy rain the Baloi and Belaga began to rise rapidly. "On the 11th I cleared up affairs in general preparatory to leaving, but the river had by this time risen too high to permit us to leave on the 12th as arranged. "On the 13th the water having gone down 1 proceeded down-river. After nearly capsizing at Wong Tukok where we shipped much waler we reached Uma Lanyieng for lunch. Calling at Uma Genouri, Punan Biaw, we then spent the night at Uma Punan Bah. Drastic measures were adopted with all these people, who have outstanding fines totalling over $400; it is obvious that they cannot be relied on to keep any arrangement they make with Government. They are still quibbling about the Forest Reserve, but as the Divisional Forest Officer is to call here on his way down they were ordered to see him about the matter. "Leaving Nanga Bah on the 14 th with water in good condition we arrived at Kapit at 3.15 p.m. The rapids were negotiated with the help of Dayaks and only one portage was necessary. "Just below Wong Kara a large whirlpool forced the outboard propeller clean out of the water, and the Dayak sitting behind the engine escaped serious injury by a fraction of an inch. This gives some idea of the powerful currents and eddies that are met with in some of these rapids. "Almost all Belaga tax was collected with exception of Punan Bah and the Punans of Ulu Baloi and Ulu Linau. The latter could only produce a few poor quality mats, all their good ones having been traded to Dayaks. The Dayaks in these Ulus are creating a problem of some gravity, and I propose going thoroughly into the matter as soon as Penghulu Sibat arrives with the various leaders of the upriver workers. "All land revenue, assessment and exemption tax was collected. . "Some system of organized trading with the interior Punans is desirable but it is difficult to see how it can be managed with the present Kapit staff of two Native Officers, and no Govern¬ ment representative at Belaga other than a village constable. "the Belaga people suffer a great deal through lack of medical treatment, and although the Dresser took up a considerable quantity of various medicines, many people had to go with- out. It is hoped to arrange for a supply of the commoner medicines to be placed in the hands of the village constable at Belaga and one or two of the chief natives. "There is some very fertile land m the Belaga district, but the general opinion arrived at is that the people as a whole are definitely lazy when it comes to farming padi; probably they have been spoiled by the ease with which they obtained money a few years ago when jungle produce was easy to obtain and high prices prevailed.” The District Officer, Mukah, reports that the Petanak grave robbery case was settled as follows. Tua Kampong Kudat was found guilty of failing to disclose and intentionally preventing this case from reaching the ears of the Government; he was charged also with receiving stolen gold, and there being an element of doubt he was given the benefit of it and sentenced to three months' simple imprisonment and fined $100 and costs under section 116 of the Penal Code. The two actual grave robbers lloh and Ludau were sentenced to nine months each (having con¬ fessed) and the goldsmith Mang Kee Lan who was proved to have received some of the gold also received nine months. As this crime is becoming unpleasantly prevalent on the Coast the Court informed the Tua Kampongs that any further cases would receive the maximum sentence. An arrangement was made with the Native Officers at Mukah that all tukang sunat should not he allowed to practise unless they have received a certificate from the Dresser saying that they have received instruction in elementary hygienic methods essential in such work. The Tua Kampongs were in agreement with this, and were requested to inform such people that failure to carry out this procedure would render the offender liable to criminal proceedings. Kampong Housing Policy was discussed with the Tua Kampongs and it has now been decided to allow no now houses or rebuilding without a certi¬ ficate after the Tua Kampong has passed the site and building, in order to prevent overcrowding. Notices have also been issued that any owners of broken-down houses will be ordered to rebuild decent ones. It is also intended to stop over¬ crowding up small streams. A good supply of seeds has been received at Mukah and some 100 or so applicants have been supplied with them, in preparation for the Agricultural Show which is to bo held on His Highness the Rajah's birthday. In view of the late arrival of the seeds an extension day for a vegetable show only has been fixed on November Quite a number of small vegetable plots are appearing in the kampongs. All seeds received from Kuching and a proportion of crops from the Demonstration Vegetable Garden are kept in stoppered bottles and particulars are recorded in a register. The new masthead electric light of 500 candle power was established at Kuala Mukah on July 1st. and so far has proved satisfactory. M.L. Leonora was towed to Kuching for repairs on the 7th by m.v. Kim Chin Soon. The Land and Survey Office staff at Mukah handed over to the District Office the Mukah Per¬ sonal Indices. Schedules of Rights, and the work of preparing land deeds, etc., on the 8th, prior to their departure to Kuching. Settlement of land is thus completed on the Coast, and the efficiency and simplicity of operation of this system (once grasped) cannot be over¬ emphasised. It should be recorded that the enormous amount of extra work done by Mr. Hammond and his staff must have resulted in this lengthly operation being completed at least two mouths earlier than would have been possible under normal working hours. The quit rent defaulter register was received and about $3,000 (i.e., approximately three quarters of total rent due) was collected. Visitors to Mukah during July included the Very Rev. Mgr. Hopfgartner, Mr. R. W Hammond and Dr. De Raaf (S.O.L.). Notices were issued at Oya drawing the attention of all traders to the Order in the Green Book which deals with the pass book system of credit trading. It is considered most essential that, this Order be enforced in this district as some of the cases which come before the Courts take an enormous amount of time to deal with, and then in the end most probably the claim has to be dismissed. Bantan anak Madang, who escaped whilst being brought down from the Ulu under arrest in May last, was retaken by Dayaks and brought to Dalat on the 25th. Bantan has been sent to Sibu for trial. The Dalat Dresser paid two visits to Oya during July and also visited Kampongs for purposes of vaccination, etc. He was away in the Ulu visiting Dayak houses in the Tamin and Lower Oya in the middle of the month. The main purpose of his upriver trip was to inquire into deaths at Rumah Mukan, Batang Oya, which have occurred during the last two months. Five persons were said to have died, and now a sixth has died. The Dresser did what he could for one person who was ill and reported that he considered the deaths due to pneumonia, and not to any type of epidemic. The following arc the figures for the month at Dalat Dispensary 222 persons were vaccinated 26 N.A.B. injections were given 85 out-patients were-treated. Notices were issued informing the public that Government would not make a charge for medicines or the Dresser’s advice to persons who were obviously incapable of paying by reason of extreme poverty This was done as cases have recently come to light in which persons have not approached Government for assistance as they thought nothing would he done for them unless they paid exorbitant sums in medical fees. A little inexpensive medicine for these people has in many cases caused relief. There is a serious shortage of padi in the Baoh and Tamin Districts, Dower Oya. and the Penghulu and local Tuai Rumah asked that a Chinese trader be permitted to establish a godown for the storage and sale of rice and sago only. This godown would be built at Nanga Tamin, and would only be allowed to remain for a period of one year or until such time as these people harvest a good crop. The reason for this request is that hawkers are unable to ship sufficient quantities of rice and sago in their boats at one time to meet with the demand. Permission has been obtained from the Resident to establish this godown. Melanau fishing was in full swing during the month at Oya, and good catches were obtained. The recent rubber tapping holiday would appear to have been a success as far as the Oya district is concerned, no cases of illicit tapping having been brought to light by the police patrols. It has been found possible to start a demonstration vegetable garden at Oya and the ground selected for it is now being cleared. The Senior Agricultural Officer has been requested to forward a selection of seeds. This garden has not been started before as the station has been handicapped by lack of prison labour. It was reported from various localities in the Dalat district that large numbers of bears were swimming the Igan from the Matu direction, and were attacking the sago palms with disastrous re¬ sults. Two gardens in the Ulu Medong have been completely finished. This matter is being investi¬ gated further, and if found to be a fact it is suggested that certain trustworthy persons be permitted to buy buckshot as it appears (hat No. 4 shot will not kill a bear unless hit in some vital spot. The price of raw sago increased again on the figures for last month by 4 cents per passu the figures being 67 cents per passu at Kut and 60 cents per passu at Dalat. The amount of raw sago exported from the Oya and Dalat districts decreased during the month, the figures being :— This shows a total decrease of 95 1/2 koyans on the figures for last month. The total amount of para rubber exported was 289.68 piculs, and of jelutong 58.13 piculs. Twelve motor schooners, one motor launch, six schooners and thirty bandongs cleared Oya during the month, the total tonnage being 792 tons, an increase over the figures for last month of 48 tons. Funeral of the Rev. Father Vincent Halder. The human remains of the Rev. Father V. Halder reached Sibu in s.s. Katong on Tuesday, August 25th. Immediately on arrival the coffin was disembarked and a short service took place which was conducted by the Right Rev. Monseigneur A. Hopfgartner, who had arrived the same morning from Kuching. The coffin was then conveyed in procession through the bazaar to the Roman Catholic church, where it remained until the funeral the following morning. This proces¬ sion was witnessed by large crowds of people, many of whom had come from long distances and who had been waiting several days, and a special guard of police had to be provided to keep wharves and roads from congestion. The funeral took place in the Mission church at 7.45 a.m. on the following morning. The church was crowded to capacity, and many of those who wished to attend the service were forced to remain outside. A Requiem Mass was sung by Father Quadekker, assisted by Father Delaney and Father Chin. Towards the end of the service Mgr. Hopfgartner gave a short address; taking for his text the words “Beloved of God and man," he said that he had known Father Halder for many years; he remembered him when he was still a student in England, where he was known for his bright and happy nature, and for his love of singing. This happy disposition he had carried through life to the very end, since his heart refused to grow old and retained always the freshness and enthusiasm of youth. Mgr. Hopfgartner went on to say that he bad heard frequent remarks about the universal confidence and respect that had been commanded by this little priest,—in his opinion this was due to the sympathy and love which Father Halder radiated wherever he went. In his daily life he set us an example which we, who remain, should try and copy; we should remember that we were fellow-passengers on a journey which brought us eventually to life everlasting. We should try and remember not to dwell on the sorrows and trials of life, but to love God and man and always to be optimistic and cheerful, because our journey-led us always onwards; we should not dwell on the past, but should look forward happily to the future. Father Halder had maintained this cheerfulness and love throughout life's journey. He (Mgr. Hopfgartner) had been told by the Fathers in Singapore that up to the end Father Halder had always been the first to give a cheery welcome to a visitor, and he had even written from hospital to say that there was no need at all to bother about him, it would be all the same whether he died in Sibu or Singapore. During the whole of his last illness he had never complained, and his conduct in what he knew to be the last few weeks of his life was characteristic of the unselfishness which was so noble a part of his nature. In the grave of Father Halder would be buried a piece of old Sibu. At the close of Mgr. Hopfgartner’s address the coffin was carried to a vault of reinforced concrete set at the side of the church almost opposite the junction of the bridge from the bazaar and the Mission road. Among those present at the funeral were Mr. C. D. Adams, Resident, Third Division, and Mrs. Adams, Mr. R. E. Le Sueur, Mr. and Mrs. B. J. C. Spurway, Messrs. S. G. Hansom, A. L. McLaine, G. A. C. Field. W. L. P. Sochon, B. Summers, G. A. Farrelly, G. H. Daly. P. C. V. Cobbold, R. W. Bormond, F. H. Pollard and R. Gotte. A number of wreaths were received from members of all communities, and flags were half- masted as a mark of respect. There could be no doubt about the spontaneity of the tributes to Father Halder from the many mourners who attended the funeral, and all the arrangements were earned out with a simplicity and lack of fr.ss that Father Halder himself won d have been the first to appreciate The whole ceremony was an eloquent gesture of the love and respect that he earned from his host of friends and acquaintances.—(Contributed.) Fourth Division News. JULY. The Ranee’s Theatre, Miri (late Capitol), was re-opened on July 31st after having undergone structural alterations. It proposes to compete with the new theatre (The Grand) which is being built by Messrs. Shaw Brothers, Singapore, and which will be ready in a week or two. This com¬ petition is regrettable but apparently unavoidable. The District Officer, Miri, reports that a contract was made during the month for the dis¬ mantling-of the Long Bridge at Riam Road and the replacement thereof with an embankment. The work was successfully accomplished and it is hoped that no further trouble with this portion of the road will arise. The road, which is important for pepper planters in the district, has been repaired for its whole length and is now open to motor traffic again. News was received on July 9th of the death of Mr. F. A. W. Page-Turner, late Resident, Second Division, and flags were half-masted as a sign of respect. Sir Andrew McFadyean, a Director of the British North Borneo Co., came ashore at Miri on the 21st and proceeded to Jesselton the same day. On the night of July 13th-14th the Limbang Post Office was broken into and the padlock of the safe forced. It is fortunate that the following night was not chosen, as that would have been the night before the mail closed, and a considerable haul might have resulted. Stamps were un¬ touched, and there was little of value in the Post Office at the time with the result that the total loss was only $1.92, being the price of stamps sold after daily cash receipts had been paid into the Treasury. The same night the lock-up fruit stall was broken open, and a small sum of petty cash was taken. It was also reported that the Borneo Evangeli¬ cal Mission at Limpasong was broken into at night, during the absence of the Priest-in-Charge, and the sum of $270 stolen. Investigations are proceeding. There has been a considerable amount of un¬ specified fever and influenza about the kampongs recently, but the health of the Limbang District as a whole has been satisfactory. The whole Limbang District and the Govern¬ ment servants in particular sympathise with Joseph Thane Kang and his wife in the loss of their ten-year old son, John Thane, who died of appendicitis in Brunei hospital on July 23rd. The District Officer, Limbang and Lawas, re¬ ports that Dayaks and other upriver natives are all busy clearing their farms for the next harvest, and practically none visited Limbang during the month. Popper from the subsidised gardens at Limbang started to come in and some was shipped to Kuching, but most of the crop is still being collected and dried. On the 1st Mr. W. Lowry, Superintendent of Trade and Customs, Miri, arrived on a visit to the Limbang District. On July 6th the District Officer accompanied Mr. Lowry to Trusan, Sundar. Awat-Awat, Kuala Lawas and Lawas, which was reached on the evening of the 7th. Mr. Lowry remained there to get a direct connection to Labuan, while the District Officer left at day¬ light the following morning to meet the Resident in Brunei, continuing to Limbang the same evening. The Resident left on the 13th for Trusan, Sundar and Lawas. On July 25th Mr. R. E. Turnbull, British Resident, Brunei, accompanied by Mr. Johnson of the P.W.D. and Mrs. Johnson, visited Limbang. travelling overland. A discussion was held into the advisability of maintaining the Limbang/Brunei road in its present condition. A considerable amount is expended by Brunei on the maintenance of their portion of the road which, the British Resident maintains, the utility of the road does not warrant. It is proposed to maintain it as a bridle-path only. The District Officer, Bintulu, reports that on July 31st the bull from the Government herd was killed and the meat sold. This animal had become vicious and had chased a number of people, including two women prisoners; it also killed a bull calf, so it was decided to get rid of it. The Agricultural Department supplied a new Seindhi bull, which arrived safely by s.s. Auby the day that the former bull was destroyed. On July 9th Land Inspector Abit was dis¬ missed from the Government Service and sentenced to six months’ rigorous imprisonment for cheating. He was replaced by Awang Annu, who arrived from Sibu via Kuching on the 31st. The District Officer, Bintulu, visited Sebauh, Pandan. Labang and Tubau during the month and found everything satisfactory. Bad weather and rough seas were encountered along the coast at the beginning of July. Tuanku Taha, Native Officer. Banin, has been granted eighty-four days’ accumulated leave with effect from July 1st. At Lawas a prisoner serving a sentence for theft, and who was working in the grounds of the hospital, was sentenced to a further year's imprisonment for stealing hospital property. Apart from this there was hardly any crime in the district during the month. The Assistant District Officer, Lawas, records with regret the death of Constable Pengiran Lubai, who succumbed in hospital to pneumonia on July 2nd. Constable Lubai entered the Constabulary in 1924 and almost all his service was spent in the Lawas district. The Lawas (Sarawak) Estates, Ltd., exported 31.360 lbs. of dry rubber during the month. SATURDAY. AUGUST 1st. 1936. Marriage. MORICE—DALY. - (On 30th May. 1936. in London. Bridger de Burgh, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. N. de B. Daly, of 86, Hardy Rond, Blackheath, London, to William H. Cameron Morice, son of the late Hubert Morice and Mrs. Morice, of 41. Yale Court, London. N.W. Local and Personal JULY. Mr. H. B. Crocker, Acting Government Secretary, who has been in Europe on sick leave, is due to arrive in Kuching on August 3rd. Mr. E. O. Bruce, Sarawak Civil Service, was married on June 30th at Caxton Hall Register Office, London, to Fraulein Hildi Kusset Immediately after the ceremony the bride and bridegroom left for Austria, where the honeymoon was spent. Mr. Bruce, who is travelling to Singapore by air, is due to arrive in Kuching on August 10th, but we understand that Mrs. Bruce will not accompany him. since she intends to stay in Europe for a few months and join Mr. Bruce later. Mr. Bruce will proceed to Limbang immediately on arrival, and will not officiate temporarily as District Officer, Miri, as stated in our last issue. While on the subject of marriages, Mr. P. Scott was a passenger on s.s. Darrel which called at Pending on July 25th. Mr. Scott was on his way to Colombo, where bis marriage to Miss Mary Bacchus will take place. On his return, Mr. Scott will act as District Officer, Miri. Mr. Scott was re¬ lieved at Lawas by Mr. A. R. Snelus, whose place at Sarikei has been taken by Mr. H. P. K Jacks. Bau is without a cadet at present. The Administration Report for 1935 has been published, and copies may be obtained on application to the Secretariat, Kuching. The Report contains a good deal more general information than formerly. Mr. B. M. D. Cordiner arrived from Singapore by m.v. Marudu on July 6th in order to take over the management of the Sarawak Electricity Supply Co., Ltd., from Mr. C. Corbin, who left on home leave on July 13th. We record with deep regret the death of Mr. F. A. W. Page-Turner, which took place in England on July 7th. No details have yet been received. On receipt of the telegram announcing Mr. Page-Turner's death all Government flags were half-masted in the First, Second and Third Divisions as a mark of respect for his memory. Although a good deal of Mr. Page Turner’s service was spent in the Third Division, his name will always be associated with the Second Division, which he ad¬ ministered for over fourteen years. An obituary notice appears in another column. Mr. C. A. Willis, a member of the Mui Tsai Commission that has recently been touring the Far East, arrived in Kuching on July 10th, and left on the 13th. Mr. Willis, who is an old friend of His Highness the Tuan Muda, stayed at Astana. On July 23rd a telegram was received from Sibu to say that Song Fort, had been broken into during the night, and a sum of about $800 stolen. H.M.S. Herald, sometimes known as ‘the packetvaart,' arrived at Pending on July 17th and left on the 20th. We are glad to hear that the Herald expects to be with us for the Autumn Race Meeting; this will be the first time that one of H.M. ships has been at Kuching for one of these functions since 1929. Jeluieng, a Dayak outlaw who was con¬ cerned in the Pelagus murder in 1934. was arrested in the Ulu Layar on July 20th. We understand that Mr. F. A. Moore, who is due to return from furlough on August 17 th, will relieve Mr. G. R. H. Arundell as District Officer, Lubok Antu. Mr. Arundell proceeds on home leave about September 28th. Mr. C. D Le Gros Clark, Chairman. Rubber Restriction Committee, paid a short visit to Singapore during the month, leaving on July 13th and returning on the 20th. We are informed that the first circus to visit Kuching for thirty years is due to arrive in the town on August 9th. This circus, which comes from Sambas, N.E.I., has the usual acrobats, and also includes such attrac¬ tions as a lion, a leopard, an elephant, and an assortment of tigers, horses and monkeys. The circus will perform for a fortnight at the Song Kheng Hai Recreation Ground, Padungan, and we wish it every success. Obituary. It is with deep regret that we have to announce the death on 7th July, 1936, of Mr. F. A. W. Page- Turner. Mr. Page-Turner was appointed a Cadet in the Civil Service in March. 1902. After serving at various stations including Simanggang, Sibu, Rejang and Bau. he was in 1910 appointed Acting Officer-in-Charge of the Batang Lupar. thus assum¬ ing control for the first time of the District which he was to administer for so many years, and with which his name will always be associated. After an interval of five years spent in the Third Division, he returned in 1915 to Simanggang as Acting Resident, 2nd Class, and at Simanggang he remained until his retirement fifteen years later. Tn 1915 there was no Resident in charge of the Second Division. His Highness the late Rajah, who spent many years at Skrang and Simanggang when Tuan Muda, retained it as his own Division from the time of his accession in 1868 until 1916, when he handed it over to His Highness the present Rajah, who was then Rajah Muda, together with the control of the Third Division Dayaks. Mr Page-Turner was confirmed as Resident of Simanggang in 1917; he became a member of the Council Negri in 1918, and in September, 1922, he was appointed Resident. Second Division, being the first European officer to hold this title since 1875. He remained in this appointment until his retire¬ ment in 1930. Mr Page-Turner had wide experience and under¬ standing of Dayaks, and enjoyed their entire con¬ fidence. His administration of the Second Division was a complete success, and his name is still one to conjure with among the older natives. "Tuan S’tarna,” as lie was always known, will be mourned by many Malay and Dayak friends who knew him to be a just man a wise and sympathetic administrator. Mr: Page-Turner served on numerous expeditions against head-hunters and other malefactors, and it was during one of these that an incident occurred which provides a good illustration of his personal courage. After halting for the night, Mr. Page- Tumer went down to bathe at a small stream, and believing the enemy to be far away, he dispensed with the usual guard. Suddenly the foliage on the opposite hank parted to reveal a group of hostile Dayaks, all fully aimed, and all very definitely ready for mischief. No whit disconcerted. Mr. Page- Turner. who. it should be remembered. was quite helpless, did not lose his head but started to rate them soundly for their lack of courtesy, asking them how they dared to disturb a European in the course of his ablutions ! No Dayak likes to he thought lacking in manners, and it is related that this particular party grew abashed at the Tuan’s well-chosen words, and eventually retired from the scene in surly embarrass¬ ment,—their departure, it is said, being accelerated by a few final stinging remarks and a shower of pebbles from the irate bather! Those who remember Simanggang in Mr. Page- Turner’s time will agree that with his retirement an epoch came to an end. The loved Simanggang, and the whole station reflected his personality. It was a station steeped in tradition, and the various adats that remained in force gave it a peculiar charm. When Mr. Page-Turner left Simanggang he took with him perhaps the last surviving traces of an old order which made up in dignity for anything that it might have lacked in modern efficiency and hustle. In 1930 Mr. Page-Turner inherited a consider¬ able property in England from his brother. He married in the following year, and leaves a widow and two children, to whom we extend our deepest sympathy. We record with deep regret the death, which occurred in Europe on July 27 th, of the Rev. Father W. van Odijk of the Roman Catholic Mission. The news of Father Odijk's death is the more tragic in that he was just due to return to this country from furlough; his passage, indeed, had actually been hooked. Father Odijk came to Sarawak in 1911 and apart from eighteen months in the Kut and a short interval as locum tenens in Sandakan, his whole service was spent in Rejang River stations, mostly at Kanowit, where he built the Convent. He was responsible for building the Church and Mission station at Durin. and in 1932 he opened up the new R.C. Mission at Kapit. He left for Europe on a well-earned spell of leave in 1935. Father Odijk will be mourned by many friends of all races in the Third Division. His was a most genial and kindly nature, (he was affectionately known as 'the Cardinal' among Europeans, a nick¬ name which suited him admirably,) and he was liked and respected by all who camp in contact with him.

REFLECTIONS OF AN OUTSTATION VISITOR We print below extracts from a. letter, which, although it was received some time ago, has not yet been published owing to lack of space. We are sure that the views expressed will prove of interest to our readers. DEAR EDITOR, I have been in Kuching under 2 weeks. I came from other parts of Sarawak to see Kuching as care¬ fully as I can. And what I saw and learned—it is io the glory of God and Rajah that Kuching town and Sarawak territory is being managed by Benevo¬ lent Heads all with the paramount object of the comfort of the population. Believe me or not. I have visited quite a no. of places of different Government, and in no where do 1 find so much sociality, friendliness. humbleness, as in our Rajah’s Domain, and the (doser we get to Kuching the Centre, we find the greater the evidence. People in Kuching I noticed do not talk so much of politics, which is good. They enjoy talking of sports, of gardening1 of planting fruits, catching fish, and planting what, and humourously I root a friend, a very old acquaintance who is like most hit severely by recent slump. With beamy smiles over a cup of coffee at a market skill—which beautifully we find a lot in markets "Say, old chap"- and a pat on the shoulder, "life is a struggle." "No struggle, no life." and laughed happily over the joke. Everyone one sees in the streets go about their work happily and people generally are getting fat and strong, Food is cheap in the bazaar, much cheaper I see than one can cook at home. Why. a friendly clerk told me—"You go to that coffee shop there in India Street which eaters for Government employees. Just order 10c. pork chop. 10c. curry fowl. 10c. soup and 2c. rice plenty—cheap. I tried there and found for 32c. and wondered how can the shop manage it at a profit? It beats me. and no wonder Government clerks in Kuching are looking fit and rosy ! Mei another lady countryman of mine. "Say auntie, where are you off so long? To market at 4 a.m.?" "Yes." "How much auntie can get?" "Sometimes $2, sometimes more, sometimes less." "Well done, auntie!” "Yes," she says, “good too Sarawak ! My children tapping rubber and get 3 catties, and I sell and buy, and my man plants." How beautiful indeed! On passing a certain good old man’s estate, 1 stopped and rested on a bench at the garden designed for public comfort—hoping some one would come out and admit me. Sure enough Mr. X's son came out. "Good day!” I said, "Good day!” he replied. "Say! why do you plant those papaya for? Fruits bigger than bodies!" Said this country and manly Ind "Wo did not pluck the fruits for we want the public to see!" ‘‘Oh! oh!" I remarked. (How beautiful in my mind I mused within myself). "Say, do you want to see my pigs?" "What pigs, friend, I have seen so many, and much?" "You come—I will show you something that the public can learn—you have never seen Buckshires and York¬ shires." Happily T followed—and little by little this manly lad explained of daily feeding and inter¬ breeding—that it’ll take 4 of these pages to explain. “We are doing it for experiment with idea the public will follow and get cheaper pork." Here is Henry Ford's idea "Pay my respects to yon from Father. I'll call another day" I said. I felt pro¬ foundly impressed that the Chinese in Sarawak were imbued with so public spirit. Well done to our Rajah and Government officers ! One day it happened to rain. Stopped at road side to shelter. Here came a Father of my Denomination. "Say, Rev. Father—What are you doing here, so far?" "Administering needs to my folds." "What needs, Father?" "Spiritual” was the answer. "Have you studied sanitation, Father?’ "No" was the answer. "Say! you have done beautifully well indeed—your fruits tell—by running those very useful schools and in your daily rounds you supplement sanitation instructions to your sheep, teach your sheep and lambs of anti-malaria and anti-fly methods.” Practically, you go a step further in advancing Religion.—for a strong body is a fit. temple of the soul and all rhe things and evidence I see in Kuching are God's works. Every man is doing God’s work. All Government employees doing God's work, all services are God’s service, and cheap fish, cheap meat, and cheap fruits and cheap services are all in accordance with God’s pleasure. "What say you. Rev. Father, is this theory right?" "Perfectly" came the answer, and for once, I found God nearer! —W. Veteran Steamer’s Career in Borneo. It is fifty years since the paddle steamer Adeh sailed from a Clyde shipyard for the island of Borneo. There, despite, the stormy sens off those wild shores, she created a record for the Far East by remaining in commission for over forty years. Her hull is still afloat and reminds us of many an exciting trip. 'The Adeh resembled one of the older Clyde steamers. She was built for Government service in Borneo, and was mainly used for keeping isolated up-country stations in touch with the outside world. As an out-station District Officer I have made frequent passages in her up and down the coast, often in very rough weather. She was manned entirely by natives. Her Malay captain was an excellent seaman, and no matter how fierce a storm was raging he would put to sea when many a larger vessel remained storm-bound in port. Though in latter years he became nearly blind he maintained absolute control of his ship, and was said '’smell" his way along the coast. Most of the chief towns are situated up one of the great tidal rivers, each of which has a shallow bar at its mouth stretching a mile or two out to sea. A narrow channel defined by stakes or buoys marks the entrance, but only at high tide is there sufficient water for a ship to enter. When the Adeh reached a river mouth at low tide the skipper, in calm weather, would solve the tide problem by deliberately running the ship aground on the bar. He would then retire to his cabin and wait until the ship refloated with the rising tide. Then he would gradually go ahead until he ■ got across. Tn rough weather, however, tremendous seas thunder across the shallows, and the slightest deviation from the marked channel means instant disaster. The ship would be thrown hard aground and swiftly battered to pieces. Entering a river on the Adeh in stormy weather I have seen as many as ten men at the wheel. A mountainous wave would tower up astern. Instead of its crashing aboard, as seemed almost certain, the stern would lift high in the air, slewing the ship right round until she was broadside on. The steersmen then pulled with all their might to bring her stern back to the seas before the next wave came to prevent it catching her abeam. If it did so it would probably roll her right over or else dash her aground. On one occasion three of us from outstations were travelling together. On board was a cargo of fifty head of half-wild buffaloes. These brutes have nu instinctive hatred of white men. Since our cabin adjoined the foredeck where they were tethered our presence made them very restive. All went well down river until we reached the mouth just before dusk. Here it was blowing a full gale. Nothing daunted, the skipper headed straight for the enormous waves breaking over the bar. Standing nearly on end, the Adeh gallantly fought her way through, and after a severe buffeting gained the open sea. Meanwhile the huffaloes had become terror- stricken at the unaccustomed motion and were tugging frantically at the ropes holding them down. So violently indeed was the ship rolling that we climbed into our bunks to avoid the boxes and other movable objects that went hurtling about our cabin floor. Later that night we were suddenly roused by a clattering of hoofs outside. The buffaloes had broken loose and were charging up and down the alleyways, carried helplessly along by the sharp rise and tall of the ship. Completely marooned in our cabin, we expected to see one of the huge brutes come crushing through the bulkhead. Luckily for us it held firm. Throughout the night the din continued, and it was not until daybreak that the weather moderated slightly. By this time many of the buffaloes had died from exhaustion. After some lively moments the crew succeeded in rounding up the few survivors. With the ship still plunging wildly we managed to grope our way on deck: and though the heavy sens continued the Adeh made safe anchorage at her destination late that afternoon. AN OUT-STATION OFFICER. [The above article, which appeared in a well- known Glasgow paper, comes from the pen of Mr. G. J. D. Walters, formerly of the Sarawak Civil Service.—ED.] An Economic Aspect of the Equatorial Forest. A great deal has been said at one time or another about the effects of deforestation in the eastern tropics. The effects of denudation and subsequent erosion of the Siwalik foothills of India with con¬ sequent conversion of the arable land of the plains to sandy wastes, the formation of Silang prairies in the Philippines, and even the evidence of deteriora-. tion and flooding in this country have been stressed but have largely failed to disturb the mind of the man in the street. And so, in reverting to the sub¬ ject, one feels that one is committing the indiscretion of flogging a dead horse. My excuse for so doing is the publication of a most interesting paper by a French forest officer whose remarks on forest problems in the colonies of Equatorial Africa show how fortunate we still are in our own region and at the same time what we may have to face if we fail to realise this and treat our forest heritage in a sane way. Monsieur Layanden, at the outset, restates the well-known fact that tropical soils are in the main relatively infertile-a fact well recognised in the. Malaysian region—and goes on to say that "primeval forests are m no sense a product of the soil. Very poor soils in equatorial regions often bear magnificent forests, capable of persisting and remaining productive indefinitely. If these areas ar? denuded of forest they degrade very rapidly and irremediably towards absolute desert. Their apparent fertility owes its existence to the forests and disappears with it. In temperate or cold countries, where insolation is low and rainfall well distributed a high proportion of the available land can be cleared with economic gain. Agricultural fertility is maintained for long periods and there is little depletion of plant food materials. In the tropics it is otherwise .... the idea is mis¬ taken that tropical forest will continue almost indefinitely to provide new land for colonisation." He goes on to show that the tropical rain-forests of Africa, which are analogous to our own, at one time covered a vastly greater area than they do to¬ day. He admits that climatic changes of an un- • controllable nature influenced forest retrogression in the distant, past, but he also produces evidence which entitles him to say that— "Though the retrogression of equatorial forest in Africa goes far back in geolo- gical time, there is no doubt that at the beginning of historical time this forest was infinitely more extensive than it is to-day .... One realises that in twenty centuries the equatorial forest has retreated almost ten degrees southwards .... This retreat is almost as great as that which took place between the end of the pliocene and the dawn of history, an interval probably two or three hundred limes as long." Tropical rain forest is regarded as a vegetational climax, which means that it has formed a balance of nature. We are apt to regard this balance as a stable one which is upset only temporarily by forest destruction such as takes place when large areas are cleared for agriculture, but Lavauden rightly main¬ tains that it is quite otherwise—in fact a very un¬ stable equilibrium, which when upset quickly tends to lower the standard of vegetable cover from high forest through scrub to lalang wastes, the process usually being assisted by fire. We have little evidence of complete deterioration to lalang in this country principally because the non-inflammable rain-forest acts as a buffer to the spread of fire, but the more extensive the clearings become, and the greater the total area of secondary forest, the more we shall have to fear in this direction. Examples in North Borneo and the Philippines and probably also in our own Bah country show that this geographical region has no special dispensation, and with pro¬ gressive deforestation we may produce conditions favourable to fire which, combined with baking of the soil, will reduce the land to complete economic infertility. The matter will then resolve itself into a question of the local climate (as opposed to the general climatic conditions of the region as a whole) which may have far-reaching effects not only on our forest resources but on our agriculture. An example of this is to be found in the Gold Coast Colony in one district of which it bad formerly been possible to cultivate the cocoa tree, but where the local climate had been so altered by deforestation that in twenty years the trees changed from their natural evergreen habit to a deciduous one, and finally failed, tn reproduce themselves. This example is quoted by an independent writer but goes to support Lavauden's contentions that the rain-forest. being the climax type, cannot be interfered with without upsetting the balance of nature and that any interference necessitated by economic considerations must bear this in mind. He considers that 30% any country where forest is a vegetational climax— this country, for example—must remain under high forest if its climatic character is to be maintained. Incidentally it is reckoned that this is just about the proportion of merchantable high-forest which remains in Sarawak. It is admitted, of course, that "no densely forested country can progress without a considerable reduc¬ tion of the forested area; but the associated idea that deforestation itself connotes progress is as false as it can be." The relative poverty of tropical soils tends to cause greater inroads to be made on nature’s storehouse—the forest soil—but "it cannot be too often repeated that a reduction in the area of the equatorial forest is not and cannot be advantageous from the standpoint of argiculture or animal husbandry. The suggestion that it is so may often serve as a pretext, but it is never a valid reason. .... There is enough room outside the present forest limits for both cattle and (Top-raising. But no real advantage can be gained without following well known rules for the conservative use of land which leave nothing to chance and cannot be ignored with impunity." Like our own forests, those of equatorial Africa contain a multiplicity of species of which only a few are commercially valuable and Lavanden pleads for a better realisation of the need for improving them "from the wild to the domestic state." Such work had been started in Sarawak but lack of funds put a stop to it. That it will have to be faced eventually is certain in order "to give to existing stands of limited exploitability new characteristics rendering them economic to exploit and conferring on them an acquired (in default of a natural) permanence . . . . The problem would appear to be not so very different from that which, in France, con¬ fronted our ancestors .... but the latter had a much easier task in that they were concerned with forest of a much less fragile nature." The last part of the paper deals with purely technical aspects but one fact emerges which cannot be too often stressed and which applies equally here—there is no hope of economic recovery of the land after it has lost its fertility and therefore deterioration must be prevented. Re-afforestation of degraded tropical soils is economically unsound and the forests must be appreciated while they still exist and not, like so many now famous names, posthumously.—T.C. A Note On Food. Sarawak ladies sing dis song Doodah, doodah Life is short but Mah Jongg's long O-oh, doodah day! This little variation on (he ars longa, vita brevis theme was suggested to me by an incident which happened some years ago. I was down on a visit to a certain town which shall be nameless, and was invited to luncheon by some manned friends of mine. I accepted with alacrity, not only because I liked my host and hostess and looked forward to an hour or two of their company with real pleasure, but also because after several months in one of the remoter out stations I was quite frankly delighted at the prospect of a decent meal. The cooking in the average bachelor household tends to become mono¬ tonous, to say the least of it, since with the best will in the world it is difficult to devote enough time to the kitchen, and one is apt to grow lazy and fall deeper aud deeper into cookie’s greasy hands. For some weeks past I had been pining for the flesh-pots of civilization. Anyhow, I arrived at my host's house shortly after twelve, and found him alone. His wife, he explained, was playing mah jongg at the club, but she would be along any minute now. Would I have a pahit? Nearly an hour later my hostess appeared, full of beans, as the saying is, and full, also of the news (let us not call it gossip) that she had picked up at the club. When she had got most of the juicier items oil her cheat, we sat down to luncheon. This was such a remarkable meal that it deserves to be described in detail. We began with fried fillets of fish that had obviously been cooked the previous night and warmed up again (inefficiently) at mid-day. These . unattractive slabs of protein were innocent of egg and bread-crumbs, and were served without any sauce or garnishing: we made up for this, however, by splashing them liberally with Worcester sauce and tabasco, and by sprinkling them with pepper, These condiments, though they certainly gave the fish a flavour which ii would otherwise have lacked, did little to improve its consistency, which was that of cotton wool that had been soaked in water and then allowed to dry. The next course was roust lamb. A dish appeared on which lay some slices of meat that looked (and last'd) like fragments of a dismembered note-case. For vegetables we had tepid roast potatoes on which the grease was already congealing, and a mixture of tinned carrots and peas which were served in a dish at the bottom of which half an inch of water washed mournfully to and fro. And inevitably we had mint sauce. Why anyone should desire to pickle good meat in mint and vinegar and so ruin not only its flavour but also its texture I have never been able to understand, but if one must have mint sauce, let it at least be made in the proper way; let it not consist (as this did) of a few spoonfuls of harsh malt vinegar in which floated some shreds of bottled mint. Well, perhaps that is enough about the meat course. The sweet, which consisted of tinned apricots and tinned milk, was followed by biscuits and little chunks of a substance alleged to be cheese and done up in tin-foil. Let us draw a decent veil of silence over the coffee. When 1 said my farewells and thanked my hostess for a delightful tiffin. I wonder a cock didn't crow somewhere. I went on my way a sadder and wiser man; at any rate, I reflected. I knew now why my host was reputed to be so ill-tempered in the afternoons. But then it was not really fair to blame my hostess,—bridge and mah jongg left her little enough time for housekeeping, poor thing. Well, I said to myself, 1 ought to have known. The meal I had just eaten was unfortunately typical of European cookery in Sarawak as a whole, and it was foolish of me to have expected anything better. But after all. when one reaches civilization after months of outstation catering .... when one thinks of the succulent fillet steaks and lamb chops, the potential mixed grills hiding coyly in the dim recesses of the cold-storage depot .... Well, a certain amount of disappointment is understand¬ able. And then my thoughts turned wistfully to a house situated a hundred miles up a certain river, and nearly fifty miles from the nearest outpost of ‘civilization.’ I readied this house one evening quite unexpectedly, and two hours later we sat down to the kind of dinner one associates with a first-class grill-room at home. I know that this sounds an exaggeration, but it is not. The meal itself was comparatively simple, but the food (all of it cold storage) was the best of its kind procur¬ able, and each course was perfectly cooked and perfectly served; and after all, what more can one expect at the Ritz? It is rather unfair to add that this particular dinner included fresh strawberries from Java served with fresh (not tinned) cream, since this was exceptional even in this particular house, where good food was the order of the day- every day. But then, of course my hostess this time had ample opportunities for the study of cookery books, since (fortunate creature!) her mornings were not taken up with mah jongg. All she had to do, apart from running a house and looking after a child, was help her husband manage an estate during the worst and most anxious period of depression.—in other words, to take the place of a European Assistant,—and act as nurse and general adviser to a large and varied labour force. So you see that she had plenty of spare time. Well, the instance I have quoted shows that it cun be done. There is no need for us to live like, pigs in Sarawak,—even where cold storage is unobtainable the exercise of a very little additional care and trouble will ensure that palatable meals are produced instead of unappetising and indiges¬ tible messes. And it is worth it a hundred times over. Yes, it can be done. And this is the whole point of this article, which was inspired by a passage in Mr. Richard Wyndham's recent book "The Gentle Savage." The wife of a Doctor living in one. of the more remote districts of tropical Africa provided Mr. Wyndham with a dinner consisting of— borish; a piroshki—a light pastry stuffed with sliced paw-paw. mango, olives, and chopped egg and onion (heavily peppered, this proved the perfect sweet-savoury mixture); a over fish of the carp type, beautifully grilled and served with a sauce of pimentos And forest seps; breast, of guinea-fowl and small cucumbers cooked in cream, and a salad of fresh lettuce hearts; and, to end the meal, a rich sweet of monkey-nuts crushed in forest honey, thickly covered with whipped cream. Apart from the guinea fowl, there is no reason at all why that dinner, should not be duplicated to-morrow in any Sarawak outstation; even lettuces with hearts can be grown without much difficulty. Yet what does one get, in the ordinary way?—Tinned soup, river prawns fried in greasy batter, chicken so tough that it is literally uneat¬ able. and tinned cheese served with soggy bread, and butter that is a mere pool of oil liberally bedecked with the corpses of flying ants. And what makes one so furious is that there is no reason for this; the materials are there, as are the cooking facilities; all that is lacking is the necessary dash of elbow-grease. That is the trouble,—that and the ghastly tradition of British gastronomy which still has a strange-bold on our middle classes. The English maintain an unholy conspiracy of silence on the subject of food. In one way this is perhaps just as well, since the less said about. English cooking, the better; but in general it is a tragedy, since it prevents the frank and open dis¬ cussion which might free our stomachs from their present disgraceful servitude to a cookery convention which is one of the worst legacies of the industrial revolution. In the eighteenth century Englishmen took a tremendous interest in what they ate, (you have only to look up contemporary journals to prove this,) and English food was probably the best in Europe; but the puritan revival which was a natural consequence of the sudden access of wealth produced by our phenomenal industrial development gave rise to a reaction in favour of a false ascetism. It didn't matter if you accumulated a fortune through child-slavery and sweated labour so long as you dutifully mortified the flesh by suffering the pangs of indigestion,—that was the reasoning. And that, loo, was the origin of the bleak and dreadful era of dullness that swept over midde-class England about 1850. Dyspepsia is the greatest natural enemy of gaiety, wit and good cheer.' And now we have to suffer for it. Any open reference to the subject of food is looked on by the average Englishman as faintly obscene, and if a man is rash enough io admit that he likes the pleasures of the table, he is regarded as definitely letting down the side; the colours of the old school tie fade with shocked dismay at the very mention of sole Mornay, and the Captains of past Fifteens turn in their graves at the whisper of the dreadful words perdreau róti an verjus and zabaglioni. To enjoy one's food is not only shameful and vulgar; it is un-British Only dagoes and a few degenerates like artists and writers take an intelligent interest in the kitchen,—-that is the point of view to-day. But as I have said, it was not always so. We all know what Dr. .Johnson said about minding his belly, and Charles Lamb stated categorically that if he found a man who professed to be indifferent to what he ate, he at once suspected his taste in other directions. This incidentally, is true to-day. In general, you will find that literature and the arts mean nothing to a man who will suffer boiled cabbage in silence; and the woman who can swallow hashed mutton is usually a soulless creature. But let us break the bonds of silence. Gastrono- mically, we English have nothing to lose but our chains and our dyspepsia. In this country, at any rate, we are at rock bottom, and if this article can serve to let a little air and light into the fetid dark¬ ness of Sarawak cookery, it will have served a useful purpose. For there is no need whatever for us to surrender tamely to the 'dead-hen' tradition. Admittedly in the Tropics the raw materials of cookery are not what they are in Europe, but let us at least make the best of them. There is no earthly reason (except perhaps our own laziness—and mah jongg !) why we should not have reasonably attractive meals every day of the week. T have hinted—greatly daring—that if it can be done in Equatorial Africa, it can be done here. Next month I shall try to indicate how it can be done. (to be concluded.) Diocesan Conference in Kuching. A TRIENNIAL EVENT. On Saturday, July 25th, all the clergy of the diocese of Labium and Sarawak assembled at the Bishop's House, Kuching. The diocese nominally comprises the “whole Island of Borneo, and the islands adjacent thereto," but in actual fact the Anglican Church only works in Sarawak, Labuan, Brunei and North Borneo. Except for two priests, who are on furlough, the clergy from all those countries within the diocese were present. In a normal diocese such a gathering is an annual event, but considerations of distance and expense compel us in this diocese to coniine ourselves to triennial meetings. The last was held in 1933. In the in¬ tervening years, the clergy meet similarly under the presidency of the Bishop, but by Archdeaconries, (i.e., Sarawak and North Borneo separately). For the first two days of the week priests were in Retreat, while the last three days were spent in con¬ ference, when many pastoral problems were brought up for discussion. The value of such conferrings will be obvious when it is realised how infrequently such opportunities occur. This year the Confere nce was marked by an event of especial significance. On the morning of Sunday. July 26th. the Bishop, in the presence of all the priests of the diocese and a congregation winch the Cathedral was not big enough to contain, admitted four candidates to the Order of Deacon. The Bishop, as celebrant, was assisted by the Archdeacon of North Borneo as Beacon, and the Rev. Chong En Siong as Sub¬ deacon. The Archdeacon of Sarawak presented the candidates, while the Rev. Father W Shelley, C.R., preached the sermon. The candidates were all mon of mature age, who had for many years been " tested" in the office of Catechist. For the lest two years they have had further and more intensive training at the Cathedral Ordination Test School, under the care of the Commumiy of the Resurrection. On the afternoon of Saturday. August 1st. His Highness the Tuan Muda most kindly gave a garden party at the Astana, to which the clergy of the diocese and the members of the Cathedral congrega¬ tion were bidden. His Highness' kindness was greatly appreciated, and it was an altogether happy occasion. On Monday morning, August 3rd, the priests will return to their various districts. —(Contributed). Films of the Month There were no outstandingly good films al the sylvia Cinema during July,—not every month can we expect a Mutiny on the Bounty, or a Resurrection,—but the entertainment-value level of almost all those that were shown was consistently high. After all, we have nothing to grumble about in a month that included such successes as Rasputin, China Seas. The Iron Duke, The Merry Widow and Brown on Resolution, to mention only five; and when it comes to stars, we didn't do so badly with Wallace Beery. Miriam Hopkins, Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Maurice, Chevalier, Jeannette Macdonald. Sidney Howard. Franchot Tone, Lilian Harvey, all three Barrymores, Diana Wynyard, Shirley Temple, and William Powell. To this imposing galaxy one must add Mickey Mouse, who appeared on four occasions; Mickey is streets ahead of all competitors in the cartoon field, and has few rivals even among the stars of flesh and blood. Mickey's Band Concert, a coloured Silly Symphony, was an example of the genius of Walt Disney at its most entrancing, and Mickey's Service Station gave full play to his impish wit: he has an astounding capacity for imbuing inanimate things with vivid personalities. Under his magic touch chairs, motor-cars and clocks come to life with an eerie reality, and umbrellas lake on the most subtle and demoniac intelligence. But let us leave the looking-glass land inhabited by Mickey and his friends and turn to what we may call the 'legitimate’ screen. The Iron Duke was very good Arliss and as such first-rate enter¬ tainment but it was also very poor history and suffered from the second-rate production that is an all-too frequent characteristic of films turned out by British studios. (In parenthesis, let me mention that an eminent American film critic remarked recently that reviews of British pictures should by rights appear on the Home Movie page : There is sufficient truth in this wise-crack to give it a sting.) In this film the Waterloo scenes, for instance, were unbelievably amateurish,—it would have been better to have left them out altogether. On the other hand the Duchess of Richmond's famous ball was very well done, and many of the interior shots were excellent. George Arliss, as always, was superb in the part of G. Arliss, and Gladys Cooper showed many of our younger act¬ resses just where to get off by her rendering of the difficult and unsympathetic part of the King of France’s niece. She knows her job from A to Z, and is a continual delight to watch. Allan Aynes- worth was perfectly cast as Louis XVIII, that fat and irresolute but withal dignified monarch. Where's George, another British production, contained of lot of delightful fooling on the part of Sydney Howard, ably supported by Mabel Con- standuros in the role of his shrewish wife. But here again the tempo was far too slow, although admitted¬ ly that didn't seem to matter so long as Sydney was on the screen He is one of the greater clowns. Brown on Resolution was not only good enter- tainment, but also excellent propaganda for the British Navy. The Naval scenes, which were photographed under the direction of the Admiralty, were tremendously effective: there is an awful fascination in the mechanical processes of destruc¬ tion. and the possibilities of naval warfare in this respect were exploited to the full. The sight of a squadron of cruisers ploughing through the sea in formation can be breath-taking in its impressiveness, and there is an undeniable majesty in the thunder of naval (or any other) guns. All the scenes taken on beard ship were absolutely accurate technically, and their interest made us toterant of a rather banal and highly improbable plot. On the whole a film well worth seeing. It was unfortunate'that the two best films of the month, Rendezvous and Splendor, ran only for one night each. The former was a delightful comedy¬ thriller dealing with America's notorious ‘Black Chamber or code-breaking bureau in time of war, and starring William Powell; the latter was a magnificently acted play on the matriarch theme featuring Miriam Hopkins, Paul Cavanagh, Helen Westley and Billie Burke. Miriam Hopkins gave a splendid performance as the interloper in a virulent¬ ly clannish new-poor family, and she was supported by a cast of unusual excellence. The acting, settings and production of this film were just about as good as they could be, and redeemed a lightly threadbare story. Another good American picture was The Case of the Curious Bride, a thriller in the Thin Man vein featuring Warren William and Margaret Lindsay. It moved with the slickness that is proof of skilled direction, and held one’s attention all the way through. Oh. in case I forget, the one and only Shirley Temple danced and sang in Curly Top. which 1 am sure was a suitable vehicle for this children star's . roguish charm. Probably those who like roguish little Shirley went to see this film.—I stayed away, so if you want to know what it was like I am afraid you will have to ask someone else. Mainly About Nothing. WHERE WAS I?—WHAT HAPPENED? The Americans are a progressive race, and a recent contributor to Ballyhoo has invented a device which fulfils a long-felt want, and one which should have its place in every home. There comes a time in every man's life (he explains) when he awakens—usually about 11.0 a.m.—to a blood-curdling consciousness and the throbbing realization that he must face a bright, sunshine-swept world. It is then that terrifying thought strikes him right between the bed and the bathroom. What did he do the night before? His befogged mind staggers back over the clock with the agonising result that there are ominous blanks of time that absolutely refuse to be accounted for. It is here (he says) that his invention comes in. It is called The Little Wonder Gap-Filling Service, and consists of a list which can be fitted into a neat frame to stand on the dressing table. All that the poor penitent has to do is to consult the Little Wonder List, and by a process of elimination fill in the gaps. He can then shake loose from the toils of alcoholic remorse and face the world with confidence. CHILDREN' HOUR. Good evening children. This is the late, great Mrs. Meyrick speaking,—from the pages of her justly celebrated history of the immortal '43' “Even our old bootleggers we loved. Perhaps they were just a trifle rough and noisy,—we loved them just the name. If anything happened to upset them in the least, knives would flash out or a shot he fired. Then all the woman would scream or go off into hysterics ....... But to me the bootleggers wore just nice, dear boy." • • MORE ABOUT PSYCHOTHERAPY. Some rime ago we published a few brief notes on the phobias prevalent in Sarawak. This month we propose to touch on some of the more interesting cases of mania that have come to our notice. According to Webster’s dictionary the word 'mania' may mean 'violent mental derangement,' but we propose to use it in its alternative and more usual sense of an excessive and unreasonable longing’ for some object or course of action. We have all heard of cases of this; for instance, when a lady of wealth and position is caught abstracting articles of value from the counters of a Depart¬ ment Store and secreting them about her person, it is not a case of ordinary plain stealing. Dear ' me. no, it is nothing so simple as that,—the poor creature is suffering from kleptomania; in other words, she feels au excessive and unreasonable longing for bottles of scent and expensive hand- kerchiefs, and so is driven to appropriate them without going through the usual formality of pay¬ ment. It should be noted, though, that this dis¬ tressing mental illness is confined almost exclusively to the upper classes; kleptomania is known as ‘shop¬ lifting’ where typists and factory-girls are concerned and usually carries with it a sentence of three months’ hard labour. But to return to our muttons, or rather manias. The following are examples of typical Sarawak manias picked at random from our case book. Is yours included? Adhaesiomania.—The craving for bottles of gum. Perticamania.—The urge to worship the truck of the station flagstaff. Pileomania. The longing to secrete fishes' heads in the hats of elderly Chinese. Scriptomania.—The furtive longing to take a piece of chalk and scribble extracts from Freud on the back of the Resident as he precedes you down a jungle path. Ariamania.—The itch to stand up and give bird imitations when presiding in Court Muscomania.—The craving for stag muss. Araneamania.—The almost irresistible craving for thousands and thousands of cobwebs. Calvitiomania.—The longing to smear bald heads with honey. The above mental ailments, while certainly dis¬ tressing, do not give local psycho-analysts any real cause for concern since they are rarely attended by serious consequences. It is altogether another matter, however, when phobias and manias become mixed in one individual: the prognosis in these cases is grave in the extreme, and they sometimes develop in a very alarming manner. As an example of this we shall merely mention that there is at present a gentleman in a certain outstation who is suffering from Sacpimcntophobiamania, i.e., who craves to fear becoming a bamboo hedge. His case is being very carefully watched. WITHOUT COMMENT. The following is an extract from the section of the 1936 Administration Report dealing with Municipalities :— "The Kuching fire brigade was called out on five occasions, but in no case was any damage done to valuable property." First Division News. JUNE. An inquiry into the death of a Chinese woman named Leong Jan Tok was held at Kuching on June 3rd. A verdict of death from natural causes was recorded. The District Officer, Kuching, visited Lundu, Simatan and Telok Serabang during the month. On June 1st a petition was submitted by 67 inhabitants of Kampong Sentah begging Govern¬ ment to reinstate Tua Kampong James of Sekrak as Ketua'an Orang Kaya. James resigned this appointment during March as a result of certain facts disclosed at an inquiry into numerous allegations made against him. It would appear that the recent patrols off the coast between Muara Tebas and Tanjong Datu have had the desired effect on smugglers. At Telok Serabang it was reported that rumours had been received from Dutch Borneo to the effect that smugglers were now afraid to use the sea as a means of importing rubber and tobacco. The District Officer, Bau, reports that a case of gang robbery appears on the records for June. The sum of $21-5 was taken, and there appears to be little hope of tracing the robbers. The actual robbery took place at the south end of the bazaar at 8.30 p.m. on June 23rd, 1936. 379 persons were treated and 109 N. A.B. injections were given at Bau Dispensary. The Dresser-in-Charge visited the Kampongs in Krokong and Jagoi district. A certain amount of free medicine was given, the total number of patients treated being 386. In addition 34 N.A.B. injections were given, and 90 vaccinations were performed. A number of Left-hand Branch Dayaks visited Bau during the month and paid in their tax. Dahan Rubber Estates harvested 17,200 lbs. of dry rubber during June. Rainfall at Bau was 4.54 inches, and at Dahan 7.61 inches. A reminder, sent to the Left-hand Branch, warn¬ ing all those who had not counted their rubber trees and sent in their census returns to do so at once, caused some thirty-five Emproh Dayaks to come to Bau in haste. They stated that they had never counted their trees, as the Government Agent who made out the returns only asked them, how many they had planted. If this is so. then most of the returns from Emproh and possibly from the Left¬ hand Branch as a whole will be incorrect. New figures are being submitted to the Census Officer for checking. The main Bau-Kuching road remained in excellent condition during the month, and the minor roads were very fair considering the traffic. The lorry was in constant use, carrying tailings, stone, and timber for roads and bridges. None of the four new gold mining companies in Upper Sarawak have as yet commenced mining operations, although extensive prospecting operations are being carried out. The average price of gold for the month of May was $58.20. Royalty paid amounted to $12,038. During the six months ending 30th June the sum of $118,536.59 in cash and cheques has been remitted from Bau to the Treasury , Kuching. The following table gives the individual output of gold for May, 1936, by the various mining companies operating in Upper Sarawak :— The District Officer, Serian and Samarahan, reports that a Land Dayak of Kerosen was sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment under Section 304 (b) of the Penal Code, and Bujang bin Musa was fined $75 or 4 months’ imprisonment for attempting to outrage the modesty of a young girl. There were no other cases worthy of mention. Dayak tax both at Simunjan and Serian has been coming in well. At Sambir, the Malays were dissatisfied with the kampong lots laid off last year and, as reported last month, they petitioned the District Officer to have them changed. The Assistant Superintendent of Surveys visited Sambir on 16th and agreed to lay off new lots behind the old kampong, and pointed out to the Malays that they should have said that they were dissatisfied with the old lots at the time of demarcation. He informed them, therefore, that the cost of re-survey may be collected from appli¬ cants for the lots, while the old lots would still be available free. They agreed to this, and undertook also to make a new kampong road in front of the new lots. Mr. J. L. Noakes, Assistant Superintendent of Surveys, visited the Sadong coast from June 16th to 18th aud explained to the Malays of Moyan, Serpan and Nonok that if they so desired the Land and Survey Department was prepared to demarcate their padi land and issue the owners with Occupa¬ tion Tickets. It was fully explained to them that there was no necessity for them to have titles if they did not wish to, but that if other people applied for their land and were willing to pay the quit rent, then they (the original owners) would be liable to lose their land since land may not be held up unless the owner has a title. Mast of the inhabitants expressed their willingness to take out titles, though the Moyau people were quite frank and said that they would probably not be able to pay the quit rent as they already had large debts to Government for the rent on their existing coconut gardens. The success of Mr. Noakes’ visit was due to the fact that land along the Sadong coast is becoming scarce, and consequently its value is increasing; the popu¬ lation, too, is increasing, and the demand for land is becoming greater. At S. Plandok, Kuala Sadong, five men all applied this month for the same piece of land. There were new applications by the Bugis for over 100 acres at S. Trasi, and seven Chinese from S. Ketup (Samarahan) have applied for 200 acres across river from the Simunjan Offices. Work on the Native Officer’s new quarters at Serian was nearly completed at the end of June. The new bazaar was opened during the month and the old bazaar of leaf attap shops was pulled down. The scheme of laying out small bazaar areas in various villages along the Sadong coast and making all traders apply for sites in them if they wish to continue trading, instead of allowing them to trade in isolated villages and become monopoly shops, is now nearing completion. Bazaar areas have been laid out at M. Tuang, Tambirat, Sebandi, Moyan, Nonok, Smrah and Sbangan, and Pendam and Jaie the last two will be demarcated shortly. The following is an extract from a report by the District Officer, Serian and Samarahan :— “I visited M. Tuang (Samarahan) again on June 12th and held a meeting of the Chinese traders, all of whom were informed that if they wish to continue trading in 1937, they must pull down their old shops in the kampongs and apply for sites in the new Tuang bazaar. The traders seemed to welcome the idea of a bazaar at Samarahan, but requested that all hawkers in boats from Kuching should be stopped for two years, as they lie alongside the villages until their boats are full, or until they have sold all their goods, and then return direct to Kuching via the lobas, thus cutting out the Tuang bazaar. The matter has been referred to the Resident, and it is possible that the shopkeepers’ request will not be allowed, but all hawkers probably be required to build shops at Tuang if they wish to continue to trade.” The Native Officer, Lundu, reports that Dresser Austin L. Reggie arrived from Kuching by m.l. Lucile on 11th and proceeded to Simatan by the same vessel the next day. He visited Kampongs Pueh, Paun, Sebaku, S&rayan, Sebiris, and Tebro and returned to Lundu overland on 20th. 23 N.A.B, injections and 147 vaccinations were performed by him during his tour. He returned to Kuching on 23rd. The general health of the station has been fairly satisfactory. On the instructions of the District Officer, a meet¬ ing of all Tuai. both Malay and Dayak, was held at the Lundu Kubu on June 30th. The object of the meeting was to discuss padi-farming at Tanjong Purun during the forthcoming season. Several applications for virgin jungle in the vicinity of Forest Reserve and Protected Forests have been made by Dayaks of Sebiris. Serayan and Sebaku for padi-farming for forthcoming season. Their applications have been definitely refused. They were told that they must farm the jerami four or five years old, and that they have to farm the next site alternatively. An inspection was made of Chung Hua School buildings at Lundu and the Committee’s attention was drawn to the bud condition of the buildings and need for extensive repairs. It appears that the repairs will be completed in six months' time. During this period the pupils will be housed else¬ where as a temporary measure. Football and Cricket. KUCHING VERSUS H.M.S. HERALD.. FOOTBALL. 18th July. KUCHING 5. H.M.S. HERALD 3. The game opeued at a fast pace, quick accurate ground passing being the main feature on either side. The Kuching forwards appeared the more dangerous set in front of goal, and after one or two narrow misses gained a two-goal lead through Dahlan and Frederick. The Herald were still playing well, however, and succeeded in drawing level before the interval; one goal being the result of a penalty. On the resumption of play the Herald fell away badly, bring unable to keep up the pace set in the first half. Kuching had a comparatively easy time from now on. and although the Herald struggled pluckily, the home side succeeded in adding three more goals to the Herald’s one (all from Kitang) before, the end.

The game on the second day did not produce the same standard of football as that on the first day, nevertheless, Kuching again found no difficulty in running out winners. Freddie Lim scored from a breakaway in the first five minutes and a little Inter the Herald drew level Before the interval Han Chong cut in from the left wing to give Kuching the load. Taha was unlucky to have a goal disallowed in this half, his first time low return drive following a clearance by the Herald goalkeeper being the best shot of the match. Shortly after the interval Han Chong put Kuching further ahead. The remainder of the game developed into a series of breakaways on the part of the Kuching forwards, but their finishing was usually poor, and in spite of the visitors' goal¬ keeper having to retire midway through this half, no further goals were added.

The Directors have pleasure in submitting the Audited Accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1936. Accounts.—The year’s working, after making provision for depreciation, Area.—The Total area of the Estate is 2,784 acres, of which 2,674 acres are under rubber, all of which is mature. During the year 678 acres of reserve land not suitable for Rubber Planting were surrendered to the Government with a view to the reduction of the Quit Rent payable. Crop.—The crop harvested during the year amounted to 636,072 lbs., as compared with 698,981 lbs. in the previous year. The reduction in output is due to the prohibition by Government of Tapping for a total of 65 days during the year. Labour and Health.—The supply of labour was maintained and remains just sufficient to meet present requirements. The health of the Force has been good. Estate— The Visiting Agent has recently reported that the Estate is in a satisfactory condition. Directorate.— In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, Mr. A. R. Malcolm retires from the Board of Directors arid, being eligible, offers himself for re-election. Auditors.—Messrs. Turquand, Youngs & Co. retire and offers themselves for re-appointment.

Since the formation of the Association in March this year very encouraging progress has been made, and the Association is now firmly established, largely due to the kindly support given by His Highness the Rajah and His Highness the Tuan Muda. Clubs which have affiliated with the Association are :— Sarawak Medical and Health Recreation Club, Sarawak Club, February Badminton Party, Kong Oo Badminton Party, Jovial Jap Party, Hollywood Party, Brothers Badminton Party, United Badminton Party, Hokien School, Persukutuan Guru. Gersik Re-Stia Jaya Club, Kampong Pulo Badminton Party, Min Teck School, Bian Seng Badminton Party, Bandar Sah Badminton Party, Sesco Badminton Party, and the Persenangan Bad¬ minton Party. The 1986 open tournament, for which the sur¬ prisingly large number of 90 entries had been received, was brought to a successful conclusion on July 15th at Dr. Wong Cheong Way's grounds at Rubber Road. His Highness the Tuan Muda, Dayang Anne and a large gathering comprising Malays, Chinese and Europeans were present to witness the final of the mixed doubles. This was a closely contested event although the players were handicapped to a certain extent by the slippery grass court, and probably they were also nervous playing before such a large "gallery." Miss Wee Sui Eng and Yeo Cheng Chin won 21—13 and 21—]2 due to better combination and to the fine smashing of Yeo Cheng Chin ; the runners-up Miss Tan Sai Hua and Morgan Chai, however, put up a very good fight. At the conclusion of the match Dayang Anne graciously presented the tournament prizes. The president of the Associa¬ tion. Dr. Wong Cheong Way. and the Datu Amar both thanked His Highness the Tuan Muda and Dayang Anne for honouring the Association with their company. The Datu Amar also gave a brief résumé of the history of badminton in Kuching and of the formation of the Association, and then called for three cheers for Dayang Anne, which were heartily given. Little Miss Wong Tshook Chiang presented Dayang Anne with a beautiful bouquet of orchids and then His Highness the Tuan Muda, in a brief speech, thanked Dr. Wong Cheong Way for his hospitality. Tn assuring the Association of his support. His Highness said that, owing to the essentially amateur spirit of the game, badminton appeared to be an ideal means of bring¬ ing the various races of the community together in friendly rivalry. Everyone then adjourned to the bar. where refreshments were served. Some of the ladies were encouraged to try a few purc-frnit non-alcoholic cocktails, but judging by the pro¬ digious feats which were later performed on the Sarawak Club bowling-alley, we have come to the conclusion that the person who made the cocktails must have used brandy instead of lemon juice by mistake. We wish to thank the following gentlemen who kindly donated prizes Dr. Wong Cheong Way, Datu Amar, Datu Hakim, Datu Bentara, Haji Bol Hassan, Abang Bol Hassan and Messrs. Chiang Wah Onn.

One appeal from the Lingga Petty Court con¬ cerning a Dayak fruit tree dispute was dismissed by the District Court, Simanggang. The appellant then appealed to the Resident's Court but the appeal was summarily dismissed. There was a large increase in litigation at Simanggang during the month. A number of Dayak laud disputes, mostly appeals from Peng- hulus, were heard. There was also one conviction for illegal plant¬ ing of rubber. Accused was fined $25 for planting two trees. Three Lingga rubber dealers were fined $10 each and costs for exceeding the maximum stocks allowed in their licences. On May 18th Chong Kui of Engkilili was found guilty of the attempted murder of Lee Jun Nyat. Sentence was deferred pending accused being placed under medical observation in Kuching. On the 21st Lau Teng Mong, a boy of 14, was convicted of causing grievous hurt by a dangerous weapon; the sentence was deferred aud the minutes of the case were sent to the Chief Justice. In the Police Court, the Juragan and Chinchu of m.t. Chin were charged on May 7th under Order No. XVI1. Ports and Shipping regulations No. 53, with carrying an excessive number of passengers. The case was adjourned sine die for the opinion of the Chief Justice. On May 10th an inquest was held by the Native Officer, Lingga on the body of Saur (/.) anak Nyaing of Rumah Lansam, Ulu Sebuyow, who was drowned when the boat in which she was travelling was capsized by waves off Tanjong Lutong, Lingga. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned. 224 patients were treated at Simanggang Government dispensary during the month, and 185 X A .B. injections were performed. The general health of the district was good. A large number of Dayaks came to Simanggang during the month to pay taxes, etc.; the land and fru.it tree dispute season has definitely begun. __________ Although the beneficial results which will result from the prohibition of tuba fishing have been explained ro all Dayaks, many of them still ask permission to tuba small side-streams. This, of course, has been refused. Re-roofing and repairs to Fort Alice, Simang¬ gang, started during May. The re-roofing of the main portion was practically finished by the end of the month. A serious boating accident occurred at Lubok Tedong near Engkilili ou May 21st. A boat-load of eighteen Chinese men. women, and children upset, and twelve persons were drowned. Had it not been for the prompt action of Tsai Kirn and his aunt who were passing in a boat, it is likely that the list of fatalities would have been even heavier. All the bodies were eventually recovered, and Mr. K. H. Digby went to Engkilili on the 22nd to hold an inquest. A verdict of death by mis¬ adventure was returned. The District Officer, Saribas reports that during the last two weeks of May thirteen persons (five Malays and eight Dayaks) were convicted of planting rubber after June 1st, 1934. In every case the prosecution was instigated by the Rubber Restriction Inspectors, and it is anticipated that there will be further prosecutions next month. No contravention of the rubber tapping holiday was detected. Towards the end of the month Penghulu Igoh was sent for and instructed to inform all his anembiak that at the conclusion of the harvest they must abandon farming huts and temporary dampas and return to their long houses. Previously a similar warning had been sent to the Spak Tuai. Such an order was absolutely essential in view of the fact that recently Spak Dayaks have been con¬ victed of harbouring rebels. It was also announced that the District Officer would visit the ulu early next month in order to ensure, that this order has been enforced. The District Officer, Lubok Antu. reports that a request was put forward by some of the Delok Tuai, including Penghulus Sambau, Sanggong. Mumin and Jantan of Menyang that Baneng and Miloh. who have twice committed incest within the last four months, should be allowed to marry. Baneng is a half-brother to Miloh's mother, but in spite of this close relationship some of these tuai-tuai—Mumin and Jantan being particularly keen—assured him that marriage was possible if the jala ceremony were performed. This request was only put forward on account of the two culprits having committed the offence twice in such a short time, and because of the general fear that the offence would be repeated almost immediately. The District Officer refused to allow the marriage, and also refused to accept money for a fine and brought Baneng down to cool off in gaol in order to keep him out of further mischief. The District Officer adds that it is amazing how Dayaks will find their way round their own adat when it suits their book. A Chinese pepper gardener named Jee Phang was found dead in his house near Sungei Sebungku at 4 p.m. on May 8th. His death was found to be due to nicotine poisoning, nicotine being found in some Chinese medicine which he bad just drunk; he only lived for about three minutes after drinking this medicine. It seems unlikely that this was a case of suicide, and it is probable that it was murder. Further inquiries are being made. JUNE. There were several prosecutions in the District Court, Simanggang, for not submitting rubber census forms. All but one of these resulted in convictions. There was one reported case of pepper-vine cutting, but no one was charged; there is very rarely a conviction in a case of this nature. The owner of the garden is probably the culprit, and cuts a few vines shortly before the pepper harvest, so as to have an excuse for not paying his debts. 191 patients were treated at Simanggang Government dispensary during the month, and 139 N.A.B. injections were performed. The general health of the district was good. Almost all exemption and door tax in the Simanggang district had been collected by the end of the month. Reports of begawai have been received from all localities. Seven doors of Skrang Dayaks took out passes to remove to the Temburong district of Brunei. Agricultural Assistants Ong Kee Hui and Ong Chin Ghee arrived during the month and inspected the pepper areas at Lingga and Simanggang, also the experimental demonstration vegetable garden at Nanga Enteban. The total stocks of black and white pepper held in the bazaar amounted to 475 piculs, 65 katis; Lingga and Pantu stocks were reported to be very small. The repairs to Fort Alice roof were finished during the month, though the drain-pipes still await completion. The old attaps have been sold by auction. The whitewashing of the Fort is not yet finished. On June 30th m.l. Rentis returned for duty at Simanggang. Considerable alterations have been made to her accommodation, which, it is expected, will make for improvement in comfort. The engine has been moved 3 feet astern from the original position. On June 1st Mr. K. H. Digby left for a visit of the ulus of the Sebuyow and Lingga rivers, start¬ ing via Sebuyow. He returned to Simanggang on the 11th via Lingga. On the 26lh the District Officer left for ... visit to Skrang and ulu, and was still away at the end of the month. On June 9th Probationary Native Officer Abang Mansor bin Abang Pong was married to Dayang Norkia, daughter of Abang Zin, Native Officer, Simanggang. There was a large reception on the evening of the 9th at Abang Zin's house which was attended by all the European officers. An excellent curry was provided. A young female maias (orang-utan), which was captured by Ulu Lingga Dayaks and brought to Simanggang, was purchased by the District Officer, permission to do so having been obtained from the Curator, Sarawak Museum. On June 4th Dresser George Ho came down from Lubok Antu to do temporary duty at Engki- lili. He returned on the 12th. He came down again on the 25th. During bis stay be vaccinated and treated several Dayaks and Chinese in the district He returned to Lubok Antu towards the end of the month. Various Tuai-tuai and Penghulus came to Lubok Antu during the month both to meet the Resident and to help to choose a new Penghulu to replace Penghulu Ramba, who is retiring on pension. Eventually Ngali anak Kijam of Nanga Guran was decided upon. The Dayaks themselves were of little or no help in electing their Penghulu. It is believed that Penghulu Ramba and his brothers are far from pleased al this appointment, which means the Penghuluship leaving their familv. Pengbulus Ramba and Ngindang went on to Kuching in order to interview His Highness the Tuan Muda. A Chinese hawker named Ah Seng, and Tek, his Dayak wife, were murdered at Kerangan Temagun, Spak, on the night of June 3rd. No head was taken. The District Officer visited the scene of the crime on the 26th. Three Dayaks have been detained in connection with this murder; it is suspected that the motive of the crime was robbery. A full report has been forwarded to the Resident, Second Division, and investigation continues. A few cases of chicken-pox were reported in the kampong during the month, otherwise the health of the Saribas district was good. The harvest in the Saribas district is now all in and the results generally are satisfactory. The District Officer reports that during his visits to up river districts he noticed with satisfaction that extensive root crops had been planted. Progress has been made in the experimental vegetable garden at Belong, which now appears to be self-supporting. During the month Malay coolies were employed clearing the first three. miles of the Betong/Simang- gang road. The road from that point to Bukit Sangkoh has been cleared with Dayak labour. Coolie labour was employed filling swamp on the Pok road, and two small temporary bridges were constructed. The main bridge over the S. Entanak was repaired and work was commenced on a number of small bridges on the main road to the Padeh. It is hoped to make this road up before the end of the year. The following are extracts from a report by the District Officer. Saribas, on a trip to the ulu :— "On the 4th, accompanied by Wan Mahadar, Native Officer, Pengarah Isek and three constables, I proceeded up river. The. first night was spent at Batu Lintang, Layar. The following day we entered the Spak and eventually spent the night at N. Tapih. "On the 6th we proceeded overland to Krapa, returning to the mam river on the 7th. and spend¬ ing the night at N. Penyuin. "On the 8th we arrived at Rumah Ulin Leui- paong : there a meeting was held to discuss the position regarding Dayaks living in temporary buildings; it was discovered that three doors had failed to comply with previous orders. No decision was reached that night, the persons con¬ cerned being instructed to present themselves at Batu Pesok at noon the following day. On the 9th at Batu Pesok the position was again discussed, and it was ascertained that a further five doors were still scattered about in temporary huts. "It was perfectly plain that these Spak Dayaks had no intention of complying with the order to return to their long bouses, but were merely playing for time in the hope that I should be transferred before the order could be enforced, and that my successor would take a more lenient view of the situation. "The Dayaks were informed that they would be given 48 hours to evacuate, after which the buildings would be burnt. It is interesting and perhaps amusing to note that in the early hours of the morning, from my mosquito net, I heard Dayaks chatting and one man say—'Of course he won’t burn, its just bluff!' "On the 10th I proceeded overland via S. Teras to Penghulu Igoh’s house at Jambu. Meanwhile a message had been sent to the Resident explain¬ ing the position and requesting approval of my proposals. "On the 11th I walked via S. Antu to Penebak, where the night was spent. The following morning I proceeded down river to N. Tiga where I met the police returning with an answer from the Resident. On the 12th I returned to Penghulu Igoh’s house. "At dawn on the 13th 1 set out for Sadok, having first despatched all my barang by another and direct route to Krapa. The first dampa, one room at the foot of Sadok, was reached at 8.30 a.m. after a stiff climb, and all property having been removed it was sent up in flames at 9 a.m. With their usual gallantry the men had deserted the house, leaving only women and children behind. "Our second objective, a three-room dampa, was reached at 9.30; here we found all the in¬ mates busy carrying out their property, and having given them sufficient time for this purpose, the building was burnt. "We then made our way towards Bukit Em- prudu and en route discovered a one-room hut without any occupants, who must have, fled at our approach. Again all property was removed and the hut burnt. "A three-room dampa between Emprudu and Lempaong was reached at about 1.30 p.m. Most of the property had been removed and placed out¬ side ; the building was deserted though the occupants could be heard moving about in the surrounding babas. The dampa- was burnt, and we made our way via Lempaong to Krapa arriving there at 6 p.m., after a very hot and tiring walk over hilly country. It is estimated that on that day we covered not less than twenty-five miles. "All four buildings were destroyed without encountering any resistance, and no moveable property of value was damaged. " I left Krapa on the 15th and arrived in Belong that evening at 7.30 p.m. "On the 24th, accompanied by the Government Auditor. I proceeded to Pusa in the Santosa and on to Debak early the following morning. On arrival at Debak I received a wireless from the Resident informing me of the Spak murder, and returned immediately overland to Betong. "On the 26th I proceeded up the Spak to in¬ vestigate the murder and relumed to Betong on the 29th." On June 19th the Rev. Father J. Sparrow left on furlough, having completed over four years’ service in the Saribas district. A large crowd was on the wharf to wish him bon voyage and a safe return to Betong. Earlier in the month the Rev. Father H. May¬ cock arrived from England; he will be in charge of the Mission during the Rev. Father Sparrow's absence. On June. 22nd Robert Than of the Junior Service was married at St. Augustine’s Church, Betong, to Hilda Tnay. The subsequent reception was attended by a large number of Government servants and other friends of the bride and bridegroom. The Officer-in-Charge. Kalaka. reports that on June 18th an unfortunate accident happened in Kampong Hilir. When a Malay cannon was fired below a Malay house, the barrel exploded and in¬ jured the Saratok Malay schoolmaser named Mas, and another Malay who was sitting in the house for the purpose of bacha khatani. Luckily no other person was injured. Third Division News. JUNE. Two Coroner's Inquests were held at Sibu during the month , one into the drowning of a male Chinese at Engkilo, and the other into a somewhat unusual occurrence in which a Foochow was burned to death after setting fire to dead grass in bis rubber garden at S. Merah. Findings of death by misadventure were returned in each case. Good progress was made during the month with the construction of the new Sibu hospital. The concrete foundations and piers are completed, and the construction of mild steel reinforcing framework for floors is well in hand. The Clerk of Works visited Song in connection with repair's to Government buildings there, and was still away on a visit to Mukah, Oya and Dalat at the end of the month. During the month police investigations into cases of suspected Foochow Secret Societies were con¬ tinued. One conviction was obtained, and two other men were required to put pledges into Court. One hundred and three in-patients and five hun¬ dred and thirty-four out-patients received treatment at Sibu hospital and dispensary during June. There were eight deaths. Fifty-three N.A.B. injections and one hundred and six vaccinations were performed. The general health of all communities was good. The Divisional Medical Officer was away from June 15th to 27th with the Travelling District Officer visiting Meluan, Poi, Kabah and the Ngemah. Capt. R. E. Le Sueur, District Officer. Sibu. returned from convalescent leave on June 23rd. Mr. E. M. Selous, Acting Secretary for Chinese Affairs, visited Sibu in connection with Chinese affairs from June 16th to 25th. Mr. J. 1'. Baird, Municipal Commissioner, accom¬ panied by Mrs. Baird, visited Sibu from the 4th to 11th. Commander Hardy, R.N., of H.M.S. Herald, accompanied by three other officers, visited Sibu on the 27th. Lieutenant Tripp, R.N., of H.M.S. Herald and five naval ratings paid a visit to Sibu on the 20th. District Officer, Lower Rejang, reports that two Binatang Foochows were fined S350 for replanting rubber, and that a Mohammedan Foochow was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for theft from the workshop of the Island Trading Co., Selalang. There was no serious crime in the Lower Rejang district during the month. On the 29th, on receipt of news of the Spak murder, Second Division, patrols were sent off to the Sarik, ulu Sarikei, Wak, Julau, and ulu Binatang. During June large number of Dayaks came down to the bazaars in the Lower Rejang district to sell their rubber. It was noticed that the ulu Julau people, only recently brought into the district, were well represented, so it seems that the previous objections to this measure are without foundation. A report that Julau Dayaks had pulled down their house and deserted it was investigated by Native Officer Abang Openg, and found to be untrue. The pepper harvest is now commencing. It is not yet possible to estimate the crop, but early reports indicate that it will be poor both at Sarikei and Binatang. Agricultural Inspector Ibrahim bin Sedik arrived in Sarikei on June 2nd for duty in the Lower Rejang district. He took over control of the experimental vegetable garden, visited Matu and two in connection with sago pests, and made several short visits to the pepper areas. It is reported that the pig-poison recently delivered to sago-owners on the coast is proving effective. Following the issue of rubber replanting notices, 24 applications for replanting were received, covering 56 gardens. The rubber inspectors were ordered to examine, these gardens and report, but with one exception they are not proving very good at the work. It is felt that more and better trained inspectors will be required. Reconstruction of the Binatang New Bazaar road was completed during-the month. Repair work on the Jakar road is nearly complete, and only gravelling remains to be done. Sarikei municipal roads are in fair condition. A contract was given out for further earth-filling to Repok and Wharf roads. The contractor started making covers for the Sarikei storage tanks. Water ran short, however, during June, and the motor-lighter started carrying water down from Leba'an on the 23rd, and was still running regularly at the end of the month. Water sold to the public amounted to 4,560 gallons, and 4,800 gallons were supplied to Government quarters and the shore party of H.M.S. Herald. Contracts were signed for the construction of three Junior Service quarters at Sarikei, and some materials are now on the site. There is some delay in the work, as the sizes of timbers were changed on instructions from Kuching, and the sawmill was unable to supply the new sizes at short notice. Instructions were received from the Shipping Master to erect a harbour beacon at Jerijeh, Kuala Rejang. This has not yet been done, as the exact position of the light is still under consideration. The clearing round Sirik light was inspected. The work appears to be complete when seen from the lighthouse, but unfortunately it was not practic¬ able to make a proper observation from out to sea, us M.L. Irene developed serious engine trouble. The Shipping Master has been asked to obtain in¬ formation from coasting steamers regarding the sufficiency of the clearing. The Land Settlement Officer. Sarikei, reports steady progress in settlement and ordinary land work, and mentions that land revenue in Sarikei for the month reached a high record of more than $2,500. Binatang land revenue also was very satisfactory, totalling over $3,000. A complaint was received from the Daro Bazaar traders that with the dying-out of the sago trade in their district, they were approaching bankruptcy, since all the rubber is being bought up by the garden shops at Kurt Saa'i, Bruit, and elsewhere. The Resident has agreed that licences for dealing in rubber should be restricted to recognized bazaar areas, and it is hoped that this measure will save Daro from extinction. The new Malay vernacular schools built by the Kampong people at Daro and Belawai are now ready, and will open as soon as books are received from the Secretary for Native Affairs. The District Officer, Kapit, reports that Peng¬ hulus Grinang, Manok Manchal, Atan and Bedimbab visited Kapit during the month. On June 13th two strange Dayaks were reported being seen at Sungei Amang above Kapit. Corporal Osman and four police were sent out in the out¬ board to investigate, but no traces were found. Dayaks in the Kapit district are still busy felliug, and very few of the upriver tribes came down during the month. The District Officer, Mukah, reports that an inquiry was held into the Judan robbery case, but insufficient evidence was available to prefer a charge. It is strongly suspected that the owner of the house himself faked the robbery in collaboration with a local goldsmith in order to try and make away with numerous pledges taken from kampong people as debt security. The owners of these pledges have been advised to claim their value in the Civil Courts, as their creditor is responsible for their safe keeping Examination of the house made it fairly clear that an outside robber would have found it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to have com¬ mitted the crime. A further case of grave robbery was reported in a graveyard at Kuala Petanak. Several arrests have been made, including a local goldsmith (the one suspected in the Judan house robbery), against whom there is very strong evidence. Further inquiries are proceeding. It is regrettable that the Tua Kampong has been of little help, rather the reverse, in fact, and it is suspected that he is cither shielding the guilty parties or is concerned himself. An examination of the graves opened showed that the robbery was extensive, no less than 37 graves being opened over a period of about two months or mure. The method of opening the graves is to cut around the surface with a parang, after which the earth is shovelled out, together with the numerous plates lying about as offerings to the dead. Tua Kampong Haji Zahwi has been appointed temporarily in charge of Kampong Tutus Hilir in place of Haji Bujang, deceased, and has been recommended for permanent charge of this kam¬ pong in addition to others. All the Mukah kampongs were visited by the District Officer on June 24th and various matters were discussed, chiefly regarding land. All were informed that registers of kampong lots (in approved kampong reserves) are being started, and no transfer without a deed will he recognised. All kampongs were visited by the Disrict Officer during the month, and a meeting was held in each Tua Kampong's house and the Agricultural Show arranged for His Highness the Rajah's birthday was further explained. Natives were urged not to put all their hopes into sago, but to plant vegetables and raise poultry, if possible, as well. Numbers of them applied for seeds, but these have not yet arrived from the Agricultural Department. The Foochow colony and rubber gardens at Skoyan wen- inspected by the District Officer on .June 24th. There are about 200 Foochows in all, owning about 80 acres of very good rubber about 10 years old. and they also rear pigs and have extensive vegetable plots and appear a hardworking and pros¬ perous colony. Mr. Philip Jitam. Clerk of Works. Sibu, visited Mukah station on June 30th. He inspected all buildings, etc., and advised on necessary repairs. He also visited the pumping station and was asked to try and prepare some plan to remove the sediment and colour from the water. The river bank erosion along the proposed blubor sites was inspected, and Mr. Jitam agreed that in order to save these sites (which is essential, and will have to be done quickly) a major work will have to be designed by an expert, as amateur attempts in tins form construction generally prove a waste of money. It was also decided to abandon a section of road on the river bank in Kampong Boyan, further repair of which is impossible owing to heavy erosion. An estimate for 1937 will be submitted to take up the water mains along the road to the wharf, and relay them from another section of mains via the Fort. With the kind assistance of Mr. Bormond of the Sarawak Elect ricity Supply Co. the new Shipping Light was erected at Mukah on June 12th. wired up. tested and found satisfactory. The light should give a good range of vision at sea, but is probably obscured to the West by high trees at Kuala Lama. An estimate has been submitted in 1937 estimates to have them felled. The old light at the Kuala was stopped as from 30th and the keeper (Ngang) retired. This means that flag signals to inform inspecting officers and the public of approach of vessels will have to stop also; these signals also informed shipping of the stole of the tide. The District. Officer, Oya and Dalat, reports that no serious crime occurred in his district during the month. The Dalat Dresser paid two visits to Oya during the month and also visited Kampongs Bakong and Teh for purposes of vaccination, etc. The work of converting the old offices at Dalat into a dispensary and small hospital was completed early in the month. The building is satisfactory. The following are the figures for the month :— 186 persons were vaccinated 29 N.A.B. injections were given 82 out-patients were treated. The bazaar and government quarters were inspected and found to be clean and in order. The general health of the district was good. All has been quiet in the ulu Oya throughout the month. Tax is still coining in. Melanau fishing has been in full swing, but the catches have been poor. A large shark has been causing considerable damage to nets. The price of raw sago increased on the figures for last, month by 5 cents per passu, the figures being 67 cents per passu at Kut, and 56 cents per passu at Dalat. The amount of raw sago exported from the dis¬ trict increased during the month, the figures being :— This shows a total increase of 190 1/2 koyans above the total exports for last month. Three motor schooners, three motor launches, six schooners and twenty-seven bandongs cleared Oya during the month, the total tonnage being 744 tons, an increase over the figures for last month of 162 tons. Fourth Division News. JUNE. Mr. E. E. F. Pretty, M.C.S., passed through Miri on June 14th en route for Brunei on affairs con¬ nected with His Highness the Sultan. Mr. H. Hugbes-Hallet, M.C.S., Assistant Resident, Brunei, met him in Miri. Mr. D. C. White arrived in Miri on June 23rd for duty as Assistant District Officer. On the last day of the month Native Officer Bijak retired on pension. This gentleman had been in Government Service since 1906, and during the past few years was second Native Officer at Miri. He was a useful and loyal Government servant. The District Officer, Miri, reports that apart from a case of illicit distillation of arrack there were no criminal cases of note during June. There was a positive plague of flies at Miri towards the end of the month due, no doubt, to ideal breed¬ ing weather. Steps, however, were taken, and the position now shews great improvement. The District Officer, Miri, records with regret the death of Lai Yin Mun, lately Court Interpreter, Miri, who was invalided from the Junior Service a few weeks ago. Yin Mun. who had eight years and two months' service with Government to his credit, was returning home to Canton, but died in Hong Kong General Hospital en route. Birds'-nests exported from Niah to date total 149.05 pikuls, and guano for this collection comes to 392.39 pikuls. Sudden storms marked the end of the month at Miri, and a certain amount of damage was done to fishing craft. There was one fatal accident as a result of a storm on the 27th. There was an appeal from the Bintulu District Court to the Resident’s Court in a case of Dayak incest. The decision of the District Court was reversed. The District Officer, Bintulu, reports that a young hull calf belonging to the Bintulu Government herd was found slabbed with a spear on the Tanjong Batu road. Steps have been taken to trace the offender or offenders, but nothing has been proved to date. On June 2nd the Resident, Fourth Division, visited Bintulu, and numerous Dayaks and Malays put their requests before him. The requests were mostly from Dayaks, who wished to move into land which is reserved for Malays and Punans, and had been refused permission to do so by the District Officer. In all such cases their requests were not granted. The Resident also visited Tatau and Sebauh. where he heard all complaints and requests put forward by the natives. There was nothing of importance to report . I’he Local Order which forbade Chinese boat traders trading in the Jelalong, Labang and Tubau rivers was repealed after consultation with the Resident during his visit to Bintulu. Mr. W. H. Avery has announced his intention of opening up a small plant at Bintulu for the purpose of sawing attaps of belian and other woods. The demand for attaps is always greater than the supply, and it is hoped that Mr. Avery’s sawn attaps will prove the argument us to whether these are better than split ones. After the long experience of the Sarawak Oilfields in using and preferring sawn attaps. it is surprising that so few other concerns have given them a trial. The Native Officer, Baram, reports that on the evening of June 9th a Chinese employee of a shop in Baram bazaar was badly burnt all over the body while lighting a Petromax lamp. He was sent to Miri hospital, where he died the following day. The District Officer, Limbang and Lawas, reports that the general health of his district was good during June. S.C. Awang remained seriously ill in Brunei hospital with what was originally diag¬ nosed as typhoid. Early in the month Constable Mohamed, who had previously suffered from fever hut had been discharged from hospital also went down with the same complaint. He, too. became seriously ill. and was transferred to Brunei hospital. For a long time S.C. Awang was in a very critical condition. At the end of the month both men were discharged and returned to Limbang, hut on the orders of the Medical Officer, Brunei, they were granted further convalescent leave, and are not yet back on duty. It appears that previous to their ill¬ ness these two men spent a night in the buffalo slaughter-house waiting for thieves who bad removed some rubber from the Customs Godown the night before, and had concealed it near the ara tree overhanging the slaughter-house; it is suspected that they were infected that night. The actual cause of their illness is unknown, and although typhoid was first definitely diagnosed, the Medical Officer later diagnosed "para-typhoid." It was first suspected that they had drunk some water from the small stream under the slaughter-house, but this was denied by the patients, and there is certainly no reason why they should drink from a dirty stream when water is laid on to the slaughter-house by pipe. Local superstition blames the hantu in the ara tree, so the actual cause of this serious illness remains unsolved. The District Officer. Limbang and Lawas, records with much regret the death from pneumonia in Limbang hospital of S.C. Brahim. This constable was a young man who had only been in the force just over a year; the son of Awang Damit of local fame, he was a very intelligent and promising member of the Constabulary. All Dayaks and other up-river natives in the Limbang District were busy before the end of the month on the clearing of their new farms. and had ceased to tap rubber some time while before the tapping holiday commenced on June 19th. The Limbang pepper crop seems very satisfactory, but the price is most disappointing. It is expected that owing to the increased number of tapping holidays, the Malays and other local natives will plant padi on a more extensive scale this year. The pontoon used on the Brunei road ferry was put on the slipway and reconditioned. Advantage was taken of the fine weather prevail¬ ing in the second half of the month to do consider¬ able repairs to the Panderuan and Berawan roads. On June 8th Mr. Scott. Assistant District Officer, Lawas, arrived at Limbang accompanied by the Native Officers of Lawas and Trusan and Penghulus and other Murut representatives for a discussion with Limbang Murut Penghulus on their customs and adat generally. All points of difference were settled in two days. Mr. Tolley of the Borneo Evangelical Mission accompanied Mrs. Tolley as far as Labuan op her way to Singapore, and then returned to the Mission in the Lubai. Two cases of voluntarily causing hurt came before the Lawns District Court during the month. There were, in addition, three cases of theft and one of forgery. The Assistant District Officer remarks that six criminal cases in a month in Lawas constitute almost a crime wave. The Assistant District Officer. Lawas and Trnsan. visited the Tagals in the ulu Merapok during the month. This small community seems as prosperous us ever. Three new. and very fine, houses have been completed since his last visit, and everyone is cheerful and contented. The Lawas (Sarawak) Estates, Ltd., exported 22,176 lbs. of dry rubber during the month. THE . The . MONDAY. JUNE 1st. 1936. Local and personal. MAY. His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie, sailed for Singapore en route for Europe by s.s. Vyner Brooke on Sunday, May 17th. A large number of friends of all nationalities came down to the boat to bid His Highness and the Dayang farewell, and as the ship cast off, three resounding cheers were given by those assembled on the wharf. His Highness was accompanied as far as Singapore by Mr. N. E. Hughes, A.D.C. His Highness the Tuan Muda arrived at Pending on May 11th, having travelled from Singapore in a Royal Air Force flying boat piloted hy Wing Commander C. L. Scott. Dayang Anne, whom we welcome back to Sarawak after an absence of some three years, arrived by the Vyner Brooke on May 15th. His Highness the Tuan Muda assumed the administration of the State on the departure of His Highness the Rajah, a proclamation to this effect being published as a Government Gazette Extraordinary on May 14th. Mr. A. W. D. Brooke arrived in Singapore on the morning of May 20th to meet His High¬ ness the Rajah, and remained in Singapore until His Highness’ departure on the 22nd. Mr. Brooke is at present attached to the Federal Secretariat in Kuala Lumpur. On May 20th His Highness the Rajah and party were entertained to dinner at Raffles Hotel by His Highness the Sultan of Johore. On the following day His Highness and Dayang Valerie lunched with Air Commodore and Mrs. Smith at the Seletar Air Base; among those present were His Highness the Sultan of Perak and His Excellency Major-General W. G. S. Dobbie, G.O.C., Malaya. In the evening a most enjoyable Chinese dinner for His Highness and party was given at the Great World by Mr. Wee Kheng Chiang, who travelled to Singapore on business by the same boat as His Highness the Rajah. We understand that Mr. Wee Kheng Chiang intends to spend about a month in Singapore. His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie sailed for Europe by the Rajputana on May 22nd. They were seen off by a number of Singapore friends, and a squadron of R.A.F. plane's acted as an escort, for the ship as she left the harbour. His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie expect to return to Sarawak in October, Her Highness the Rance following two or three months later. We wish them a pleasant voyage and an enjoyable stay in England. The Spring Meeting of the Sarawak Turf Club was held on May 2nd and 4th, and provided two very good days’ racing, a full account of which will be found under ‘First Division News. The popularity of the meeting was reflected by the large crowds that attended, and by the size of the prizes in the cash sweeps. The races are always an enjoyable break in the humdrum life of Kuching, and the Turf Club is an institution that deserves our fullest support. ‘Race Week' officially started, with the arrival in Kuching on April 29th of the Second Division contingent consisting of Messrs. P. M. Adams, W. P. N. L. Ditmas, N. Mace and J. C. H. Barcroft. H.H.M.Y. Maimuna arrived with the main body of visitors on the 30th. These were as follows : From the Fourth Division: Mr. H. E. Cutfield, Mr. W. S. B. Buck, Mr. and Mrs. J. O. Gilbert, and Mr. and Mrs. D. L. Leach; From the Third Division: Messrs. A. Macpherson, J. C. B. Fisher, B. Summers, D. R. Lascelles, A. R. Snelus, F. L. Crosslev, S. G. Hansom, and Mr. and Mrs. Field. " Mr. and Mrs. L. K. Morse arrived from Bau on the same day. The last visitor to arrive was Mr. J. B. Archer, who took a passage from Miri in the R.A.F. flying-boat which reached Kuching on May 1st. Most of the outstation visitors left Kuching by the Maimuna on May 8th, but certain officers stayed on for a few days in order to attend meetings of the Committee of Adminis¬ tration. party were entertained to dinner at Raffles Hotel by His Highness the Sultan of Johore. On the following day His Highness and Dayang Valerie lunched with Air Commodore and Mrs. Smith at the Seletar Air Base; among those present were His Highness the Sultan of Perak and His Excellency Major-General W. G. S. Dobbie, G.O.C., Malaya. In the evening a most enjoyable Chinese dinner for His Highness and party was given at the Great World by Mr. Wee Kheng Chiang, who travelled to Singapore on business by the same boat as His Highness the Rajah.

Archer, who took a passage from Miri in the R.A.F. flying-boat which reached Kuching on May 1st. Most of the outstation visitors left Kuching by the Maimuna on May 8th, but certain officers stayed on for a few days in order to attend meetings of the Committee of Adminis¬ tration. A very cheery party was given at the Kuching Residency on the evening of May 2nd, Mr. and Mrs. F. H. Pollard being 'at home' to most of the European population of the town. The dance lived up to the best Race Week traditions, and carried on until the small hours, when it broke up into a number of subsidiary parties, also in accordance with established custom. The survivors, when they met next morning in the Club, were unanimous regarding the excellent evening that they had spent. On May 4th, a most enjoyable dance was given at Astana, His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie receiving about seventy guests. The Astana dance during Race Week is always a most popular function, and this one was no exception to the rule. The dance went with a swing from the start, and when the guests left shortly after midnight they were tired but happy. Our thanks are due to His Highness and Dayang Valerie for a delightful evening. H.I.J.M.S. Yuubari, a flotilla leader of the Imperial Japanese Navy, arrived at Tanjong Po on May 14th, her arrival coinciding with the second day of the races. An account of her visit will be found elsewhere in this issue. Mr. R. E. Le Sueur, District Officer, Sibu, who was admitted to the General Hospital suffering from typhoid fever on April 22nd, was discharged on May 14th. Mr. Le Sueur sailed by the Vyner Brooke on May 17th on a month's convalescent leave, and is at present staying at Fraser’s Hill. Another casualty in the Government Service during the month was Mr. D. C. White, District Officer. Kalaka, who was admitted to the General Hospital on May 4th. Mr. Griffin has taken over the Kalaka district temporarily, and Mr. White, who was dis¬ charged from hospital on May 16th, is at present doing duty in the District Office, Kuching. The R. A. F. flying-boat which brought His Highness the Tuan Muda to Kuching left Pending on May 13th on a tour of inspection of flying-boat moorings. In the course of this tour she visited Sibu and Miri, returning to Kuching on May 14th, and leaving for Singa¬ pore the following day. The flying-boat, which was piloted by Wing Commander C. L. Scott and Flight Lieutenant L. H. Stewart, carried as passengers Messrs. C. E. O. Wood and C. E. Bailey of the Civil Engineering Department of the Air Ministry, and Mr. R. E. Edwards, of the Public Works Department. These gentlemen stayed on for a few days at Miri and inspected landing-ground sites both at that station and Bintulu, returning to Kuching by H.H.M.Y. Maimuna. The Rev. Father T. F. Delaney, of the Roman Catholic Mission, returned from home leave on May 4th, and proceeded to Sibu a few days later. Kuching’s official rugby season came to a close during Race Week, when a most enjoy¬ able game was played in which a number of outstation officers took part. We would like to take this opportunity of expressing the gratitude of all players and sunporters of the game to Mr. K. L. Whale, without whose un¬ flagging enthusiasm and energy the game would never have been carried on the way it was. We can only express the hope that the seed he has so laboriously planted has not fallen on stony ground. We print under Third Division News' the programme of an exhibition of local arts and crafts, poultry, flowers, fruit, and veget¬ ables, that is to be held at Mukah on His Highness the Rajah's birthday. We wish all success to this exhibition, which is being organised by the District Officer. Mr. J. G. Anderson; it is an original idea, and should do much to stimulate the interest of the large Melanau population in local produce Mrs. E. Banks returned from a trip to Japan by the Vyner Brooke on May lath We welcome to Sarawak the Rev. F. H. May¬ cock, who arrived by the same vessel to join the S.P.G. Mission. We understand that the Rev. Maycock will be stationed at Belong. H.M.S. Herald, sometimes known as ‘The Sarawak Flagship,’ arrived at Pending on the evening of Thursday, May 28th, having had an extremely rough passage from Singa¬ pore, the weather encountered being most unusual for this time of the year. The Herald is commanded by Commander N. A. C. Hardy, R.N., whom we welcome hack to Sarawak after an absence of about four years. Commander Hardy was in command of the Herald when she was working in Sarawak waters in 1931 and 1932. H.M.S. Herald left Pending at dawn on June 1st for the Rejang. A survey party under Lieutenant R. T. Tripp is being landed at Sarikei, and will remain at that station for about two months H.M.S. Herald is ex¬ pected to call again at Pending towards the end of July. It is pleasant to see the familiar shape of the Herald once again in Sarawak waters, and we are glad to hear that we shall probably be seeing a good deal of her in the course of the next eighteen mouths. A visitor to Kuching during May was Pastor V. E. Hendershot, M.A., of the Seventh Day Adventist Mission. Although stationed in Penang, Pastor Hendershot is continuing his oversight of the mission's interests in the State temporarily. He left by the Katong on May 28th, and expects to return for another visit within four months. On the afternoon oil May 15th, a garden party was held at Astana which was attended by a large number of guests of all communi¬ ties, who thus were able to welcome His Highness the Tuan Muda personally, and bid farewell to His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie. The weather, fortunately, was fine, and the party was most enjoyable. A programme of music was rendered by the Kuching Military Band, and the improvement in the playing due to the new instruments so kindly presented to the band by His Highness the Rajah a short while ago was noticeable. The person who left two books named Japan Advance and The White Paternoster in the guardroom at Pengkalan Batu may have them on application to the Kuching Police Station. Birthday of His Majesty King Edward VIII. The following Circular despatch has been received from the Secretary of State for the Colonies through His Excellency the British Agent for Sarawak, and is published for general information :— "DOWNING STREET, 3rd April, 1936. "SIR, I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty’s Birthday will be celebrated both at home and abroad on the 23rd of June next, unless in any particular case that date is not convenient. 2. If. for any reason, it is desired that the celebration should he held on any other day than the 23rd June, the date selected should be sub¬ mitted for my approval 3, The fact that His Majesty's Birthday falls within the period of Court Mourning need not interfere with any arrangements usually made to celebrate that occasion. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (Signed) J. H. THOMAS.” Chartered Bank. EIGHTY-8EC0ND ORDINARY GENERAL MEETING. We print below extracts from the address of Sir William Foot Mitchell, who presided at the eighty-second annual general meeting of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China in the absence of Mr. Willis, the Chairman of Directors. The meeting was held at the Bank premises, 38 Bishopsgate, London, E.C., on April 1st, 1936. WOBLD TRADE. “You will have gathered from a perusal of the chairmen's speeches at the annual general meetings of the big British banks that the recovery in domestic trade—which during the past year or so has principally revolved round the building trade and its ancillary industries- has been well main¬ tained . “A welcome activity in steel and shipbuilding became apparent towards the end of last year, and this activity should increase in volume in these and their allied industries when the British Govern¬ ment's new rearmament programme is put into full swing. “Due to the many quotas, exchange restrictions, and currency troubles throughout the world, inter¬ national trade, I am sorry to say. has not shared in prosperity to the same extent as in the. domestic arena. The restrictions to which I have referred have, in fact, had the effect of compelling many large consumers, c.g., Germany, Russia, the South American countries, etc., to resort to the primitive method of baiter, with disastrous results to the exchange of goods on the orthodox lines we have been accustomed to during the past sixty years or so. “As was pointed out in the Press the other day, the overseas trade of the United Kingdom for 1935 was £800,000,000 less than in 1929. and a good deal of this tremendous shrinkage must be laid at the door of the numerous restrictions to which I have just called attention. “It must be obvious, therefore, that the British overseas banks and the shipping companies, which depend so largely on international trade, are the worst sufferers from the many obstacles now put in the way of the free movement of goods throughout the world. “The competition for the exchange on the res¬ tricted turnover is keener than ever, and margins are now whittled down to such a fine point that, at the end of I he year when we come to strike a balance, the result is often very disappointing indeed. It says much, therefore, for the acumen and capability of our overseas managers that their operations con¬ tinue to enable your Directors to maintain our present dividend. “The British Government’s declared policy, as you know. is to try and arrive at mutual agreements between the various countries in the world with a view to the revival of international trade, but that they are finding many obstacles in their path goes without saying—the principal one being currency uncertainties the world over. “I regret I can see little hope of a revival in world trade until sanity returns to the Councils of the Nations, and until the artificial bolstering of crops and industries—the production of which would be quite uneconomic without this assistance—gives way to a more rational policy of apportioning the pro¬ duction of goods to the countries which are best suited to produce them. “I am afraid, however, in the present temper of the world, that time is some distance off, but it should be the aim of all of us who are interested in world trade to-day to do everything possible to assist the attainment of the object I have just mentioned. In his speech last year, Mr. Willis dealt very fully with regard to trade in general in the various countries throughout the East, where this Bank is represented, and the reviews received from our Eastern Managers at the end of last year indicate no material change in the situation. I shall, how¬ ever, endeavour to give you a short review of other matters of importance in which the Rank is in¬ terested." “Mr. Willis, in his speech last year, referred to China's currency problems and to the steps taken by the Chinese Government to offset the effect of rising silver prices upon exchange quotations. At the same time, the Government had endeavoured to counteract a serious depiction of the country's monetary and capital resources by imposing an export tax on silver. Illicit export, however, continued on a large scale. Currency scarcity, accentuated by the uncertainty of exchange, caused an abnormal rise in rates of interest, with consequent heavy falls in real estate values and in all investment securities. This in turn affected the stability of the smaller Chinese banks and financial institutions and some failures occurred. "On 3rd November last the Government of China issued a currency decree the main provisions of which were: (1) The nationalisation of all stocks of silver, including those held by banks, and pro¬ hibition of the use of silver as a means of payment. (2) Making the notes of the three Govern¬ ment banks full legal tender. (3) To attain the stability of the exchange level of the Chinese dollar through the Government banks buying and selling foreign exchange in unlimited quantities at certain fixed differences. "Although the sliding scale arrangements in force a year before meant that China's currency had be¬ come detached from silver, a sort of decree nisi, the above pronouncement indicated that not only had China absolutely divorced herself from silver but that she had adopted a managed currency. "For many centuries silver had been a very intimate factor in China's economic structure, although we have the strange anomaly that China is not a producer of that metal. Nevertheless, China had come to look on silver as her standard of value; it had been the medium of settling deficits and surpluses in her overseas trade, and the surplus wealth and the savings of her people had been invested in the metal as a matter of course. "It is naturally not without misgivings that we view this momentous change to a managed currency instigated by her Government. The principal reasons for these misgivings may be briefly summarised: (1) The Budget remains unbalanced. (2) Customs duties and other Government revenues are declining. (3) The political situation in North China is very unsettled. "The heavy import duties which have been imposed on a variety of commodities have had the effect not only of raising prices to such an extent that consumption has been curtailed, but also of making smuggling more attractive. Government revenue has consequently suffered. "It is, therefore, very necessary for the Govern¬ ment to take steps either to augment their income, which may be difficult, or to effect radical economies in expenditure. "The great essentials for the success of a managed currency are integrity of the Budget and an efficient Currency Board or Reserve Bank which will effectively oppose demands for inflation in any form or disguise. Only thus can complete confidence in a paper currency be fostered and maintained. "A severe fall in the world price of silver would, of course, prejudicially affect the value of the silver reserves held against the note issues and might necessitate a readjustment of exchange parities. That in itself need not, however, adversely affect the scheme. "The present stabilised rate of exchange on a low level has already given a stimulus to the export of China produce, so that China's balance of trade shows a more favourable tendency in recent months. "In view of the close trade relationship between China and Hongkong, it was inevitable that the Hongkong Government should follow China. Silver stocks held by the banks in Hongkong have been taken over by Government and the exchange value of the Hongkong dollar has been allowed to fall in closer approximation to the Chinese dollar. "The Hongkong Government have not yet, however, announced the rate of exchange at which they are prepared to stabilise the local dollar. In order that there may be an alignment between the two currency units, it is only natural that Hong¬ kong should wait for China to give a fixity value to their dollar which savours of permanency.” MALAYA. Rubber. The production of rubber, as yon are all aware, is controlled by an International Committee under a scheme which was started in June, 1934, and which embraces all the principal producing countries. Taking all the many difficulties into consideration, I think it can be said that much good progress has been made towards placing the planting industry on a sound and healthy basis. "The year 1935—the first complete year of con¬ trol—was a rather disappointing one from the producers' point of view, as the average price over the twelve months was only 6d. per lb., the highest price reached being 6 3/4 d., and the lowest 5 1/2 d. Moreover, in order to achieve this price, it was necessary to decrease production by 5 per cent, during each succeeding quarter of the year from 75 per cent, for the first quarter down to 60 per cent, for the last—an average production of 67 1/2 per cent, over the whole year. "These figures will show you why I have referred to last year's results as rather disappointing, but they Will also indicate the disastrous position in which the rubber planting industry as a whole would have remained had no control been exercised. "A much more cheerful note, however, can be discerned when the relative position of supply and demand at the end of last year is examined. Here we find that the recorded stocks of rubber in the world have declined during 1935 by about 100,000 tons, while consumption has been well maintained, and in some quarters notably increased. It is estimated, for example, that America used 40,000 tons more rubber in 1935 than she did in 1934. "Since the beginning of this year the price of rubber has risen to the neigbourhood of 7 1/2 d. per lb., and the prospects for 1936 are much more encouraging.” JAPAN. "Japan's record of recovery and trade expansion since she abandoned the gold standard continued during 1035. Money was cheap, foreign exchanges steady, and exports reached the highest point in her history. Commodity prices continued to rise slowly, but this welcome improvement did not affect raw silk. “Alongside this record of trade expansion and recovery there was a continuance of heavy arma¬ ment expenditure, but the gap in the budget (defence now accounts for 46 per cent, of Japan’s expenditure) was met by domestic loans, which continue to be absorbed without any apparent difficulty, but one begins to wonder when saturation point will be reached. “An increase in the price of raw cotton would, I think, affect Japan more seriously than Lancashire, owing to the greater devaluation of the Yen, but this again would probably be offset by the steady and ample supplies of intelligent labour which Japan industrialists have at hand, and to the lower standard of living of the workers. The con¬ tinued depression on the land forces a steady flow of labour from the farms to the factories, which prevents wages from rising, and the main food of the workers, which is produced in Japan, is still comparatively cheap. “In connection with these remarks about Japan, 1 cannot pass on without a word about the very unfortunate affair which occurred at the end of February, resulting in the assassination of several of Japan’s most experienced statesmen. “As a resident for a number of years in Japan, and the recipient of numerous kindnesses and courtesies from her people, high and low. I deplore this savage attack on constituted authority, which would appear to have been the result of mis¬ guided patriotism on the part of certain youthful elements in military circles. “Many of the culprits, as you know, paid the penalty by sacrificing their lives in accordance with Japanese tradition. A new Cabinet is now in power, and, as far as can be gathered, it is function¬ ing normally and has restored confidence.’’ Shorts. After all, there are shorts and shorts, some of them more than others. And anyway, surely it depends on what is inside them. It’s the filling that counts, as the dentist said. There are times and places for everything, even castor oil; so why not shorts? Nobody now gets up and yowls about the bathing dresses we wear, and in all conscience there’s not much of them. I suppose there was just the same fuss when farthingales and stomachers came in (or went out). I always thought “China Becha” had something to do with Malay divorce. This would appear to have been an error. Crushorridaphobia—the fear of having hairy legs. Does anybody ever read ‘Letters to the Editor’? And if so, are they ever converted by them? Are you going to stop wearing shorts? Quite. So what’s all the fuss about? —(Contributed.) Commercial Aviation News. DUPLICATION AND REDUCTION. It is not surprising that, duplication of the Brisbane-Singapore air service has been found necessary. From the opening of the service on 10th December, 1934, the public were quick to sense the value of this air route through Western Queensland and North Australia to Singapore and London. Moreover, they continued to show their appreciation by extending a patronage that resulted in air mail and passenger loadings far in excess of all anticipa¬ tions and frequently beyond the capacity of the weekly service. That they will not be slow to appraise the proportionately greater value of duplication is certain, for the value of duplication in this case goes far beyond that of doubled frequency. The benefit to be derived from increased Overseas mail facilities by the general business community is patent. Equally so, ns in the case of all transport systems, is the value of increased space for the carriage of passengers and freight. It is only by taking concrete examples, however, that the true value of a duplicated air service can be determined. Duplication will enable residents of Western Queens¬ land towns to travel by air to Brisbane, spend a day and a half in the city and return home, all in the short space of three days. Before the opening of the Brisbane-Singapore air service Darwin’s sole link with the South was a monthly steamer service. The aeroplane brought Darwin within 33 hours travel of Brisbane. Dupli¬ cation will make possible a journey from Brisbane to Darwin, a stay of two days at that Northern centre, and a return trip to Brisbane, all in the remarkably short space of 54 days. Duplication will enable an Australian business man to mark off 12 1/2 days on his calendar and in that time travel to Singapore, spend 5 1/2 days there, and return to Brisbane—less than a fortnight for a journey that takes six weeks by sea! Similarly each town along the Brisbane-Singapore air route will be brought into closer contact with the commercial centres of Australia and the East, as well as with other neighbouring towns. The benefits of duplication, however, will not be confined to increased mail, passenger and freight facilities. Appreciable reductions in fares and freight rates, as announced by Qantas Empire Air¬ ways to conic into effect with the commencement of the twice a week services on 15th May, will bring the cost of air transport on the Brisbane- Singapore-London route to a price level more than comparable with surface transport. In association with Imperial Airways the through fare from Australia to London has been reduced from £244 to £200. The Brisbane- Singapore fare drops from £80 to £65. On the Australian section the following fares from Brisbane will come into effect with duplication, the former fares being shown in parenthesis :— To Roma £5 (£5/15/-); to Charleville £6/10/- (£7/5/-); to Blackall £9/5/- (£10/5/-; to Longreach £10/10/- (£11/15/-) to Winton £12 (£13/10/-); to Cloncurry £15 (£17); to Mt. Isa £16/10/- (£18/10/-); to Camooweal £18 (£20/10/-); to Brunette Downs £23/10/- (£26/15/-); to Newcastle Waters £26 (£32); to Daly Waters £28 (£34); to Darwin £30 (£40). Duplication in the case of the Brisbane-Singapore air service means an increase with a decrease—an increase with a decrease of cost. Surely an ideal combination ! Japanese Cruiser in Sarawak Waters. VISIT OF H.LJ.M.S. YUUBARI. H.I.J.M.S. Yuubari, a Second-Class cruiser of the Imperial Japanese Navy, arrived at Tanjong Po on the morning of May 4th, 1936. On board were Rear-Admiral B. Hosogaya and a number of civilian officials, including Mr. S. Yosano from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Tokio. The Yuubari, which was on a cruise of the Malayan Archipelago, had already visited Saigon and Bangkok and was on her way to Pontianak. Band- jermasin and Sourabaya. This vessel, though designated as a Second-Class cruiser, is actually employcd on Flotilla Leader duties, and is based on Formosa. The Yuubari was met on the morning of May 4th by Mr. N. E. Hughes, A.D.C. to His Highness the Rajah, and Mr. K. Kurahara. the Manager of Messrs. Nissa Shokai, Ltd., but owing to the fact that the arrival of the Yuubari coincided with the second day of the races, the official programme was postponed until May 5th. The length of the Yuubari prevented her from coming up to Pending, and she was therefore compelled to remain at Tanjong Po. A number of officers and civilian officials, however, came up to Kuching by the Betty on the evening of the 4th. H.H.M.Y. Maimuna left before dawn on May 5th to bring Admiral Hosogaya and his officers to Kuching, and the official landing took place at noon. As the Maimuna passed Fort Margherita a salute of twenty-one guns was fired from the Fort battery; ns soon as she anchored oil Astana steps she was boarded by Mr. W. F. Lick, Acting Government Secretary, and Mr. H. M. Calvert, Acting Treasurer, and all the officers then landed, the Siamese State barge, which was manned by a crew of Malays in national costume, being used for this purpose. When the Admiral reached the top of the steps the General Salute was sounded, and the Constabulary guard of honour, which was drawn up on Astana lawn, presented arms. The Admiral inspected the guard and was then met in the Astana porch by His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie. Members of the Committee of Administration and Council Negri, together with the heads of the local Japanese community, were waiting on the Astana verandah, and were introduced to the Admiral. Refreshments were handed round, and His Highness the Rajah welcomed Admiral Hoso¬ gaya and his officers to Sarawak, and proposed the toast of the Imperial Japanese Navy. At the con¬ clusion of the reception, Admiral Hosogaya, Lieutenant 8. Yamakawa (his Flag Lieutenant), and Messrs. Kurahara and Suenaga remained to luncheon; the remaining guests dispersed. In view of the fact that no accommodation was avail¬ able on shore owing to the presence in Kuching of outstation visitors for the races, His Highness the Rajah placed H.H.M.Y. Maimuna at the disposal of the officers of the Yuubari for the period of their stay in Kuching. In the evening a dinner for Admiral Hosogaya and his officers was given at Astana, the heads of the local Japanese community being present. After dinner His Highness the Rajah proposed the toast of ‘His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Japan.’ to which Admiral Hosogaya replied with ‘His Highness the Rajah.’ Dinner was followed by a programme of Kayan and Dayak dancing, which took place on Astana lawn and which was greatly appreciated by the visitors. On the con¬ clusion of the dancing some Kayans handed the Admiral a parting drink to the accompaniment of the Kayan drinking song, which was rendered with great gusto. His Highness the Rajah then pre¬ sented the Admiral with a beautiful Kayan parang Hang, and the officers returned to the Maimuna to the accompaniment of a final manjong from the assembled Dayaks. On the evening of May 5th Messrs. Nissa Shokai, Ltd., gave a most enjoyable dinner to the Japanese officers at the Rest House. Members of all communities were invited to this dinner, which was a great success. Speeches were made in Japanese by Mr. Kurahara and Admiral Hosogaya, and in English by Mr. Khan Ah Chong and Mr. W. F. Dick. The latter, replying to the toast of 'the guests.' said a few words recalling the tradi¬ tional friendship between Japan and Great Britain; he expressed the pleasure of all communities in Sarawak nt the visit of the Yuubari. which was the first Japanese warship to visit Sarawak since the war, and concluded by hoping that this visit would soon be repeated. The gathering then broke up. On May 7th Hits Highness the Rajah, Dayang Valerie. and a party of about twelve, which included representatives of the local Japanese community, were entertained to luncheon on board the Yuubari by Admiral Hosogaya. This luncheon party, which was a most cheerful affair, was much enjoyed by all present, and resulted in the European guests learning at least one word of Japanese, namely “Kanpai,’’ which is apparently the Japanese equivalent of “No heel-taps.’’ Before leaving the ship presentations were made to His Highness the Rajah, Dayang Valerie, and Mrs. J. O. Gilbert, who was one of the party, and the guests departed amid a salvo of farewells. No description of the luncheon would he complete without some mention of Contain Yamamoto, the Yuubari'8 Captain, who contributed greatly towards the success of the party and did much to add to the entertainment of the guests. When the Maimuna, by which the guests had travelled down to Tanjong Po. returned to Kuching, everyone was agreed that a delightful day had been spent, and all joined in hoping that the Yuubari would be able to visit Sarawak again. The following telegrams were exchanged between the Maimuna and the Yuubari :— From Admiral Hosogaya to His Highness the Rajah : "On leaving the beautiful country of His Highness I must ask him to accept the expression of my most sincere thanks" From His Highness the Rajah to Admiral Hosogaya : "Your visit greatly appreciated wo all enjoyed your company and hope you may be able to visit us again fullstop Be«t wishes for a pleasant voyage very many thanks far your charming hospitality Sayonara" and the following telegram was despatched as a final send-off by the remaining members of the party :— "Captain Yamamoto, warship Yuubari Kanpai! Sarawak Officers.” Fashionable Chinese Wedding. DAUGHTER OF MR. TAN SUM GUAN MARRIED. The marriage of Miss Tan Choon Kee, only daughter of Mr. Tan Sum Guan, to Mr. Then Mian Fob of the Sarawak Steamship Co., Ltd., took place at the residence of Mr. Tan Sum Guan on Wednesday, 27th May. Among those present to witness the wedding were Dayang Anne and some European ladies. Mr. Tan Sum Gunn in a short speech thanked the guests for gracing the function with their presence, and mentioned the fact that Chinese marriages in the reformed style are much more simple and convenient to everybody concerned, and that this was the reason why he had adopted the new style in preference. Dayang Anne proposed the health of the bride and bridegroom, which was drunk by all present. An "At Home" was after¬ wards held at which a few hundred friends of all races were present, making the occasion a great success. A dinner was given by Mr. Tan Sum Guan on 30th May at his residence, "The Terrace." His Highness the Tuan Muda and Dayang Anne being the guests of honour. Mr. Tan Sum Guan expressed his most sincere thanks to His Highness and all the guests for the great honour they had done him by their presence, and said lie could not find suitable words to express his thankfulness. He particularly thanked Dayang Anne and the other ladies who came to his house tn witness the wedding. He believed that a Chinese marriage in the reformed style was not so interesting to the European ladies as one that was formerly held in the old-fashioned way; he hoped, however that they had enjoyed what they had seen. He then proposed the health of Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee, and following that the health of His Highness the Tuan Muda and Dayang Anne. Both toasts were drunk with great enthusiasm. His Highness the Tuan Muda, while thanking the host for his invitation, referred to t he valuable services which Mr. Tan Sum Guan and his uncle. Mr. Ong Tiang Swee, C.S.S., had both rendered the country, and said that tliew services were deeply appreciated by Government. He then proposed the toasts of the host and the bride and bridegroom, and gave his best wishes to the newly-married couple for their future happiness, long life and prosperity. The bridegroom then replied in a few words thanking His Highness for the kind words so touchingly expressed.—(Contributed.) White Hermit of the Jungle. The following cutting from the London Daily Sketch has reached us from British North Borneo:— "Daily Sketch" Correspondent. "In the wilds of a Borneo jungle a London man lives as a hermit. He has cost civilisation behind him for ever. News of the man. a Mr. Summers, who states that he was formerly a scenic artist at the Drury Lane Theatre, London, comes from Mr. E. C. Clark, an expert on tropical timber, who is in the jungles of Borneo. "One morning." Mr. Clark related to the Daily Sketch, "I saw a native prow being paddled up the river. In the fragile boat, that was packed to the top with household goods, sat a white man. "Coming ashore the man presented an amazing sight. His hair hung to his waist, while his beard came to his knees. "He told me that he had grown tired of civili¬ sation and had made up his mind to leave it for ever.” Despite Mr. Clark's efforts to dissuade him Summers, who was about 58 set off alone into the dense forest. Seen Again. Some months later, when Mr. Clark was on a trek accompanied by a party of native bearers, in a remote part he saw a tiny shack built on the banks of a turbulent river. On the shore stood an old, white-bearded man casting a line into the water. It was the ex-scene painter. Mr. Clark did not visit him, but left the man to his self-imposed isolation and to the secret that had driven him from civilisation. Mr. Clark attributes his safety among the head¬ hunting Dyaks of Borneo to "going native" by participating in tribal ceremonies." Next time the brass-hats of the Kuching Amateur Dramatic Society want any scenery painted, they have only to send an expedition to the interior to drag this King Beaver out of his jungle fastness. If unwilling to assist, he might be tempted by an offer to let him participate in the tribal ceremonies that sometimes take place at the Sarawak Club late on Saturday nights. First Division News. APRIL. Forty-eight civil and the same number of criminal cases came before the Kuching Courts during April. Of the latter, twenty-nine were for breaches of Municipal by-laws. The sentence of death passed upon Mahidi bin Marawin for the murder of his father, Mara win bin Ludang, was carried out on April 9th. Mr. A. F. R. Griffin left in the Lucile on 26tb to patrol the coast for rubber smugglers, and was still away at the end of the month. He also visited the Land Dayaks in the Skrak area to inform the people that K.O.K. James had resigned, and that they were now directly under the control of the District Officer. Kuching. James was elected T.K. 8krak. Mr. R. G. Aikman, Rubber Census Officer, and Mr. G. F. J. Pegler, Acting District Officer, Kuching, arrived in the Sambas Onderafdeeling of the Residency of Dutch Western Borneo from Lundu on April 16th. Every assistance was afforded them by the Gezaghebbcr van Sambas. Mynheer Ansingh. whose hospitability was respon¬ sible for the very pleasant nature of the visit. An inquest was held at Bau on the body of Poh Thai (male), Foochow, who was found dead in the Ban Dispensary bathroom; a verdict of suicide by strangulation was returned. No serious crime was recorded in the Bau Dis¬ trict during April. Reports of offences under the Rubber Restriction Orders, however, are received almost daily hour hundred and thirty-three persons were Heated at Bau Government Dispensary during the month, and eighty-two N.A.B. injections were given. • The Dresser-in-Charge paid a visit to the Singghi kampongs during the month. He reports the kampongs as being fairly clean, and the general health satisfactory. A total of forty six eases were treated there, the majority free. As a result of the survey made by Abang Haji Adenau. it was found that the Senah Dayaks had no ground on which to base their claim that Netherlands Indian Dayaks were encroaching on their farming land. Dalian Rubber Estates harvested 25,201 lbs. of dry rubber during April. Rainfall at Bau was 7.43 inches, and at Dahan 12.43 inches. The new car park at Bau was completed at the end of the month, and will be put into use when the necessary by-laws are sanctioned by His High¬ ness the Rajah. Continual rain interfered with public works generally, and with road work in particular. Bidi road, though, is improving greatly. Repairs to Tondong road were put in hand towards the end of the month. The following table gives the individual output of gold from the various mines for April, 1936 :— The District Officer, Serian and Samarahan, reports that on April 18th a Chinese named Chai Kui was arrested at Tebeduk for selling charms to the Dayaks of Kampong Entebuh, and for imperso¬ nating a Government servant. During the month T.R. Mangki of Merit applied to move from his present place to N. Mrakai on the Gedong river. His application was approved since Merit is a terrible place to get at in the swamps between the Gedong and Simunjan rivers, and has not been visited for seven years. T.R. Gimang of Ensebang asked permission to move to the true right-hand bank of the Ensebang river opposite the Balai Ringin protected forest, and his application was also approved as his present situation is bad, being far away from any running stream. Tn the dry season their bathing pond becomes quite dry. The harvested has been gathered in the Sadong District and on the whole has been a success, but in the ulu Simunjan Kiri the ravages of rats have destroyed a greater part bf the crop. The Native Officer’s quarters at Tebekang and the old padi store at Simunjan were dismantled during April, and any serviceable timbers shipped to Serian to be used for the Native Officer's house. The Serian new bazaar is nearing completion. Mr. E. H. Elam, District Officer, Serian and Samarahan, submits the following report on a visit to the ulus of the Simunjan and Gedong rivers :— I visited the ulu Simunjan and the ulu Gedong with Native Officer Abang Dan, from April 2.3rd to May 4th. All houses visited, and in each 1 informed the inhabitants of the new tuba-fishing regulations, the rubber tapping holiday, the new regulations about only tapping in the forenoon; I also told them that the Dresser from Serian would be in Simunjan even¬ month at the full moon, and would stay there for eight days. "The inhabitants of the left-hand branch of the Simunjan, who are Sebuyau-Balan people and more civilized than the right-hand branch, seem restless. They are continually having quarrels amongst themselves, and they try to break up into small houses of four or five doors. The people in the right-hand branch are Undup- Bala, and seem far more contented although the restriction on the sale of buckshot and the regulations about having to return the empty cartridge-cases seem to irritate them consider¬ ably. I understand, however, that they circum¬ vent the regulations by buying No. 4 shot, opening up the cartridges, and substituting larger home-made pellets. "At Sabal Kruin T.K. Ngumbang was told to (Hear the boundary (as settled by Government last November) between the First and Second Divisions in conjunction with T.R. Sli of Ulu Lingga, preparatory to demarcation in June. The Dayaks of Sabal complained al>out Chinese and Malays who are working timber there felling trees near the river which later fall into the stream and block it up. "I arrived at the ulu Gedong on May 1st, and understand from the Melikins that ex-Sergeant- Major Lallak has been examining land in thc Melikin country and is going to apply later to be allowed to farm there. His application should be firmly refused as (1) Sea Dayaks are not allowed across the Ensebang river; (2) he wants to farm in an area which is stocked with very good timber; (3) owing to the new Protected Forest at Balai Ringin. farming in this area must he forbidden otherwise the Melikins, Chinese and Malays will have a legitimate com¬ plaint that there is no timber left outside the Protected Forest. Already the Melikins are complaining that the Malays and Chinese are using up all the belian in the S. Ansabang, and shortly there will be none left outside the Protected Forest." The Native Officer, Lundu, reports that the general health of the station was fairly satisfactory Dresser-in-Charge Mohd. Sn’ut arrived on March 17th, and left for Kuching on April 4th. During April five persons were dealt with at Lundu for offences under Orders R—3 and R—4 (Rubber Restriction). Rugby. RACE WEEK GAME. On Tuesday, 5th May, the Kuching season came to a close with a game on the Police Padang in which a number of outstation officer's took part. It proved probably the best and fastest game of the season, and was probably enjoyed by a fair number of spectators. The sides proved very evenly matched, and the result, a win for the Colours by 3—nil, was probably the fairest result that could have happened. Noakes' try was a well-taken effort, and he showed a glimpse of his old New Zealand form in the way he went for the line. Late in the game Whites got a chance to draw level when they were awarded a penalty in a fairly easy position, but kicking a greasy rugger ball with a sodden "gym” shoe is not an easy proposition and the attempt failed. There was a lot of open play and running by the backs and, amongst the Asiatics, Saleh and Lian Seng showed good form. Whale brought off some good runs and was unlucky not to score after one fine individual burst. Amongst the forwards Gilbert was outstanding and played with great gusto right to the final whistle. Most of the others seemed to find the pace a bit hot for them, but the scrumming was maintained at a higher standard than in any other game so far, parti¬ cularly by the Whites forwards under the able leadership of A. G. Taylor. Rain before the game and at half time made the ball very greasy, and many passing runs broke down in consequence. The Asiatics almost all showed a distinct improvement in their play, but they must curb a tendency to pass anywhere with¬ out looking round, when they are challenged. Once they have mastered the art of accurate passing the standard of play should improve con¬ siderably. Mr. Kitto handled the game very well, keeping things going with the minimum of fuss or whistling. The teams were as follows :— Sarawak Turf Club Spring Meeting 1936. RESULTS. FIRST DAY..

UNLIMITED CASH SWEEP SPRING MEETING, 1936. ARTHUR G. TAYLOR, G. T. M. MITCHELL, Scrutinisers. MINUTES OF THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SARAWAK TURF CLUB HELD AT THE SARAWAK CLUB ON THE 3RD MAY 1936 AT 11.15 A.M. Present.—Messrs. J. B. Archer (in the Chair), P. M. Adams, G. T. Bates, W. J. Chater, Ong Hap Leong, Chan Qui Chong, W. S. B. Buck, W. F. Dick, Datu Shahbandar, Messrs. W. Har- nack, H. E. Cutfield, B. Summers, Datu Amar, Messrs. N. Mace, W. Philp, G. J. Dickson, R. E. Edwards, Abang Bisunie and Messrs. R. W. Chater, Tan Sum Guan, etc. etc. (1) The Minutes of the previous Annual General Meeting were read by the Secretary (Mr. G. T. Bates) and approved unanimously. (2) The Accounts for the financial year were passed unanimously. (3) Mr. Philp was appointed Auditor—proposed by Mr. P. M. Adams and seconded by Mr. Cutfield. (4) The question of Selling Lotteries was dis¬ cussed and Mr. Bates proposed and Mr. Adams seconded that they should be abolished—passed unanimously. (5) Mr. Buck proposed and Mr. Dickson seconded that the commission on the Sweeps should be reduced to 10%. It was pointed out that the Club was well in funds. A long discussion took place, Mr. Bates remarking that, the Club depended mainly on this commission for its revenue. Mr. Philp said that if the commission was reduced to 10% the Club would not probably pay its way. Mr. Adams proposed and Mr. Ong Hap Leong seconded that the commission be reduced to 15% not 10%. On the vote being taken on Mr. Buck's proposal there were only two supporters—on the vote for the amendment a majority were in favour of 15%. It was therefore decided that 15% should be tried for the corning ratting year. (6) Mr. Sum Guan proposed that a stand be built near the Tote for persons on the slope. He produced a rough plan. The cost, he said, would be about $1,500. Mr. Mace seconded this. There was considerable discussion and it was pointed out that the entry to the Course was free except to the S. T. C. Stand. On the vote being taken this pro¬ posal was defeated by a large majority. (7) Mr. Dick proposed making terraces instead. This was referred back to the Committec. (8) Mr. Dick proposed and Mr. Adams seconded that the Club Committee should meet the Race Course Development Committee with a view to coming to some arrangement regarding the latter's activities. It was pointed out that obstructions might be built which would impede the view of the racing. Considerable discussion ensued and finally on the motion being put to the vote the voting was 13 to 4 in favour of Mr. Dick's proposal. (9) In connection with the above it was men¬ tioned that the Bank had a mortgage on the house on the hill in the centre of the course and it might be good policy to buy this and present it to the Development Fund. In any case nothing definite can be decided now and the Committee, as stated, have been empowered to open negotiations or suggest other arrangements. (10) At this stage the Chairman (Mr. Archer) and Mr. Adams had to leave owing to urgent business elsewhere. (11) The new Committee was than elected and showed no change and was as follows :— Kuching Members :— MINUTES OF COMMITTEE MEETING OF THE SARAWAK TUBE Club HELD AT THE SARAWAK CLUB ON 8TH MAY, 1936 AT 6.80 P.M.

The vote is taken. All but Mr. Qui Chong agree to Mr. Holl’s suggestion.

(3) Points arising out of this year’s General Vetting :— (a) Commission on S.T.C. Unlimited Sweep.— ir. Bates suggests that the extra 5% goes to the Larters. Mr. Tan Sum Guan dissents. Mr. Wee Kheng Chiang suggests as an amend¬ ment that if there are only 4 startes, the 3rd and 4th horse should get the same and the balance should go to S.T.C. Later Mr. Woe Kheng Chiang withdraws his amendment. Mr. Bates suggests that if there are only 4 starters, the 4th horse gets 10% and the 3rd horse gets 15%. Mr. Tan Sum Guan proposes that the 4th horse gets 3 prizes. This is later withdrawn. Finally it is unanimously agreed that if there are only 4 starters the 3rd horse gets 15% and the 4th horse 10%. (b) Terraces and Stand.—-Discussion took place and it was agreed that a Sub-Committee of Mr. Bates. Mr. Wee Kheng Chiang and Mr. Chan Qui Chong and the Datu Shahbandar should examine the ground and decide what should be done. (c) Race Course Development Committee.— Discussion took place. It was finally agreed that Mr. Kheng Chiang's proposal should be followed, i.e., that a Sub-Committee be formed to enter into negotiations io purchase the house in the middle of the course at the lowest price subject of course to the decision, of this Com¬ mittee.

All tennis players will be very pleased to hear that the Committee have listened to our tales of woe with a kindly car, and have authorized the construction of another bitumen court. Also the existing bitumen court is to be given a thin coating of bitumen and sand, after which it should not need further attention for many years to come. The work to the existing court will not take longer than a couple of days, so players will not be incon¬ venienced at all. We also intend to gradually repair the surface of the two earth courts near the Club by improving the drainage, and by top-dressing with sand and lime. Then there will probably be a few pennies over to defray the cost of mending same of the bigger holes in the nets. When these improvements have been completed the Sarawak Club will possess four really good courts, and so we are looking forward to a very successful season. This year it is intended to start the annual Club tournament in July and we hope all tennis players will show an interest and enter for the various events.—(Contributed.) Second Division News. APRIL. Two hundred and eighteen out-patients were treated at the Simanggang Government dispensary during the month, and 147 N.A.B. injections were performed. The District Officer, Simanggang, records with regret the death of Dayang Jerah, widow of Datu Haji Tamin, which occurred on April 24th. A Dayak named Man, and a boy named Em- pading, of Rumah Asin, were drowned in the Batang Lupar on April 21st while transporting padi from their fanning but by boat. It is presumed that they were overtaken by the bore. Man’s body was recovered on the following day. Harvesting is in full swing in the Batang Lupar area. Average crops are reported, but it is too early as yet to form a definite opinion. The Native Officer, Engkilili, reports that on the morning of April 26th a Chinese girl aged 11 named Lee Jun Nyat was the victim of a cowardly attack while selling cakes in the kaki lima of Engkilili bazaar. The assailant, a Chinese named Chong Kui, attacked the girl with an axe, and indicted serious injuries on her head before he was arrested by a policeman, who happened to be close at hand. The dresser came down from Lubok Antu in order to attend to the girl. Several Engkilili pepper planters report that their pepper vines are dying as the result of an apparently incurable disease. Mr. G. R. H. Arundell arrived at Engkilili from Lubok Antu on April 2nd, and left on the 7th, having settled many cases. Visitors to Betong during April included Mr. W. P. N. L. Ditmas, District Officer, Simanggang, and the Bev. Father 0. Philippe, c.n. In spite of further heavy rainfall, reports on the padi harvest throughout the Saribas district are satisfactory in general. It is estimated that 75% of the Saribas Dayaks had finished harvesting by the end of the month. The District Officer, Betong, visited the Padeh on April 7th, and returned to Betong on the 12th. Most of his travelling was overland, and he therefore had an opportunity of inspecting numerous farms, nearly all of which appeared to be very healthy. In general farming land appeared sufficient for the population; rubber cultivation was extensive, the standard of the houses visited was good, and the people seemed contented. Third Division News APRIL. Twenty-five civil and forty-six criminal cases came before the Sibu Courts during April. One case of attempted murder was dealt with at Sibu, and investigations were made into a reported theft of $350 cash from a shophouse in the bazaar. Oil the 29th a Coroner’s inquest was held at Sibu upon the body of a male Chinese child aged 4 years, found drowned at Sungei Merah. A finding of death by misadventure was recorded. The Assistant Superintendent of Lands, accom¬ panied by. Wan Druce, left on 16th for Rajang to accompany Mr. Snelus on a visit to Daro, Matu, Sarikei, and Binatang, returning on the 20th to Sibu. Rejang station was handed over to the Settlement Officer, Mr. T. E. Parker, on April 17th. The Senior Forest Officer completed his tour and left for Kuching on the 9th. During this tour the following stations were visited : Kapit, Kanowit, Sarikei and the Island Trading Company at Sela- lang. At Kapit the Senior Forest Officer took the opportunity of waiting the Pelagus rapids. The trip was made by outboard. He endorsed the opinion of the. Divisional Forest Officer that these rapids are no bar to systematic logging. If the logs were taken over at a collecting station at Pasir Nai (Pala Wong), floating down on the purchasers responsibility, and re-formed at Nanga Pelagus or in the dead water below, natives would assist willingly. It is easy to see how the Pelagus rapids have acquired such a bad reputation with the native. It is the last hazard before jungle produce is safely delivered in the Kapit bazaar, especially so for produce which must be transported by boat, and is not able to look after itself as a log can. Even in the case of logs, however, rather than go to the trouble of breaking his raft above the rapid and re-forming it below them, the native will wait for flood water and float the logs down en masse and take a chance. In this it is difficult to draw the line between adherence to adat and sheer laziness. On the return journey, the site of the old Kapit Fort at Nanga Balleh was examined as a possible sawmill site. Later it was decided that in the event of a large mill being ostbalished in Kapit, a site in Sungei Kapit near the R.C. Mission would be more suitable. A general dis¬ cussion on protection and logging was held with the District Officer, Kapit. At Selalang the 8.F.O. discussed remedies for stopping friction between firewood workers and the Company’s bark collectors in the Sarawak Mang¬ rove reserves. This matter mainly concerned the First Division. The Manager of the Island Trading Company was also asked to co-operate in the collection of data of the yield of mangrove bark per acre by getting his bark workers to work one or two samples areas under departmental super¬ vision, This he agreed to do, although his labour seems casual in the full sense of the work. The 8.F.O. also visited the floating ditch con¬ structed by the licensee working Bukit Lima Forest Reserve. He expressed the opinion that the licensee would have done better to have (in¬ structed a "German" railway which would have operated equally well at a lower constructional cost. There were two inquiries as to the possibility of shipping logs to Singapore. This was brought about by the reduction of freights by the Steam¬ ship Company. Further inquiry, however, brought to light the fact that this reduction did not affect the logs, so the project will probably be shelved again. Piling to foundations of the new Sibu hospital is still in progress. It is expected that piling will be completed at the end of May. The construction of three new Clerk’s quarters in Green Road is in progress, the main frameworks and fixing of belian shingles having been com¬ pleted . Contracts were signed during the month for the re-roofing of the Administration Offices, and for the reconditioning of shophouse No. 28, Black¬ smith Road. A total of eighty-eight patients underwent treat¬ ment in the out-patients department of Sibu hospital. Fifty-three N.A.B. injections and 101 vaccinations were administered. The general health of all communities was good. The District Officer, Sibu, Mr. R. E. Le Sueur, proceeded to Kuching per s.l. Chamois on the 21st, for medical treatment, accompanied by the Divi¬ sional Medical Officer. R.A.F. Flying-boat No. 2 (K.3592) commanded by Squadron Leader K. B. Lloyd, A.F.C., visited Sibu from 24th to 25th, to inspect the new mooring buoys. The other officers were Flight-Lieut. Cole and Pilot Officer H. J. Hobbs. Four Japanese gentlemen connected with Messrs. Nissa Shokai Ltd., visited Sibu during the month in order to study local agricultural conditions; later, they proceeded to Kanowit accompanied by Ong Kee Hui, Agricultural Officer. S.S. Kampar sustained slight damage on the 20th in coming alongside the Sibu concrete wharf, the belian fendering and cantilever beam of which were cracked. Only one criminal case of any importance came before the Kapit Courts during April, Chiew Chin Cha, a Foochow hawker, being sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment for cheating by selling medicine and charms to Katibas Dayaks. The Kapit Dresser accompanied the District Officer up the Merirai and Balleh during the month, and all children were vaccinated. The children up the Gat were vaccinated by District Officer and the Native Officer. Penghulus Atan, Grinang. Jugah, Manok Man- chal and Puso visited Kapit during the month. The majority of the padi in the Merirai, Balleh,- and Gat districts is good, only about five houses having poor crops. During April Chop Lee Hua (28 parties) rafted to Sibu 130 logs. 30 logs remaining at Kapit. The District Officer, Kapit. reports that the people of the Merirai, Balleh and Gat seem con¬ tented with life; there arc no general complaints. Every house was visited, forty-four in number, and explanations and instruction given about such matters as tuba-fishing, opening of appeals, farming, Kapit hospital, payment of tax and other matters of public interest. Haji Sa-in, Javanese, was fined $275 at Sarikei on charges arising from his attempt to smuggle an orang-utan out of the State, and was sentenced to two months' imprisonment in default. No other cases are worth of mention, and there was no serious crime in the district. One of the periodic Melanau witchcraft scares occurred in Bruit. where thirteen people alleged themselves to he possessed by evil spirits emanat¬ ing from an old lady named Haji Salmak. All symptoms disappeared on the arrival of the Dresser. Large numbers of Dayaks came downto Sankei and Binatang Bazaars towards the end of the month to sell their rubber. Pcnghulus' district boundaries in the hinterland of the Lower Rejang were slightly altered, the ulu Julau being included in Penghulu Nyambar's area under Sarikei. and the Pedanam river being given to Penghulu Umpor under Kanowit. A meeting of pepper gardener and dealers held in Sarikei on April 1st, and was well attended by the Foochow and Cantonese communities. The gardeners naked for an experimental garden at Sarikei, and appeared anxious to cooperate in any measures taken to eradicate disease in the pepper- vines. and to learn improved methods of culti¬ vation. A report on this meeting has been forwarded to the Senior Agricultural Officer. The District Officer. Lower Rejang. reports that in the course of a Dayak tour he was agreeably surprised to find several really good Dayak pepper gardens in the ulu Bayong, a tributary of the Sarikei. The gardens were very well kept, and indicate that the Dayaks have profited from the example of the Cantonese planters who have settled extensively in the lower readies of this stream. The padi is now harvested throughout the Lower Rejang district, and reports indicate that with the exception of the Sarikei Lemanak and the Sungei Binatang Dayaks, the harvest has been reasonably successful. The Julau Dayaks appear to have done very well, though the Dayak farmer, like his western counter¬ part. is reluctant to admit a good harvest. The following are the trade figures for Sarikei and Binatang for the month :— The clearing of the Kelepu and Bulat roads, a total of about cloven miles, was satisfactorily com¬ pleted by contract labour, and a contract was made for repairing the last two miles of the Jakar road at a cost of 12 cents per fadiom. Sarikei Municipal roads were cleaned and repaired during the month by prison labour. About 300 feet of the road in front of Binatang New Bazaar was washed away by flood and tidal water. A contract was signed for re making this mad, with mangrove sheet-piling on cither side to guard against further erosion. Contracts were signed for clearing and felling the jungle round the Cape Sink light, which is now far inland and obscured by the foliage of pedada trees on the coast. The following are extracts from a report on an up-river lour submitted by Mr. F. L. Crossley, District Officer, Lower Rejang "I left on a Dayak tour on April 20th, accom¬ panied by Aheng Shara-ee, Probationary Native Officer. We travelled by Chinese launch up the Sarikei river as far us N. Badal, thence overland up the Bayong, and across to the ulu Sarikei. The improvement in the condition of the long- houses Since I last visited three Dayaks in 1932 is most noticeable. “I spent three nights in the Sarikei river, suiting nine louses, then left Rumah Penghulu Seli and walked over into the Wak to Rumah Penghulu Nyambar. whose new house is nearly completed. It is built of solid helian and is one of the biggest Dayak houres I have ever seen. "Poling down the Wak, we then boated up the Julau as far as Rumah Banyi, Dayu. Five houres in the Wak, and three in the Julau, were visited. I returned by boat down the Julau. up the Wak, and by boat and launch down the Sarikei over, arriving at Sarikei on the 28th. "The usual lecture on rubber restriction, tuba- fishing. and general adat was given at each house where a night was spent, and all outstanding case- were n-ttled. An interesting case in the Julau was one of tugong bula. wherein the people of one bouse erected the usual heap of twigs and branches as an everlasting monument to commemorate the alleged lie of a local witch-doctor who failed to keep au appointment with a would-be patient. The tugong was ordered to be pulled down and destroyed, and the perpetrators were fined.” On the night of the 30th, a Foochow lunatic attempted to force his way into the District Officer's bungalow at Sarikei, but was repulsed by the Village Constable on duty. He then broke into Mr. A. R. Snelus’ bungalow, smashing in the panels of the front door and three interior doors. He was arrested while assaulting the cook's wife, and later sent to Sibu hospital. An inquiry is in progress to ascertain why the police did not arrest this man when the report was received, an hour before the disturbances. The District Officer, Oya and Dalat, reports that Wat bin Aso who was sent to Sibu last month for medical observation and treatment in connection with his attempt to commit suicide returned to the district under escort and was sentenced to four months simple imprisonment. On April 20th Tua Kampong Atir reported that eight graves had been opened at Penat on the 10th and 13th respectively. The Police have made three arrests, and these persons are on remand pending trial. Tua Kampong Atir’s conduct is to be considered after the accused have been tried. The Mukah Dresser paid his usual routine visit to Oya during the month. The bazaars and Government quarters were inspected and found to be clean and in order. The general health of the district has been satisfactory. Owing to the swarms of mosquitoes at Oya steps are to be taken to spray ditches with special oil. Below are extracts from a report on an up-river trip submitted by Mr. J. C. B. Fisher, District Officer, Oya and Dalat. “On 10th of the month, accompanied by Awang Lai, N.O., I proceeded to the ulu in the outboard Paddy. I returned to Dalat on 19th. During the trip most of the houses in Penghulu Chendang’s and Penghulu Untol’s districts were visited. It was found impossible to proceed to the extreme Ulu Pakoh owing to floods, but the nights of 13th and 14th were spent in the Penghulu's new house at Selabai and up-river Tuai Tuai Rumah were called down. The fort at Nanga Pakoh was inspected and found to be in fairly good repair. The night of 17th was spent in Penghulu Untol’s house and T.R. Itang of the extreme Ulu Oya was called to meet me here. An aum was held at Rumah Rantai, Nanga Pakoh, on 15th to consider what was to happen to the persons formerly living in Rumah Sinja and Rumah Nyanau as both these houses have broken up and their inhabitants are now’ living on their farms. Both houses were formerly in Untol’s district, but now many of these doors wish to join houses in Chendang’s district. The aum, although not yet finished, was most satisfactory, and it appears that the matter can be amicably settled between the two Penghulus. “During the trip a total sum of $375 was collected, of which $316 was door tax for the current and past years. “The policy of Government concerning the issue of cartridges was explained, as also was the position as regards the outlaws still at large. “The importance of the tongkat system of com¬ munication was impressed upon all Tuai Tuai Rumah, and the recent Orders concerning rubber tapping, the forthcoming tapping holiday, the manufacture of scrap rubber, and the Order pro¬ hibiting tuba-fishing were all explained. “There were no outstanding cases to be heard. “At Rumah Rantai, Nanga Pakoh, it was found that a woman named Abun anak Sinja has been shut up in a cage for some time as it is alleged she is mad, and dangerously so. Steps will be taken to have her certified and removed to Kuching.” The bad reports on the padi crop received from the Ulu Oya last month are now found to be in some measure, exaggerated. Padi crops in the three Dayak districts were reported as follows :— (a) Penghulu Dagang's District, Lower Botany Oya and Tamin.—The crop in this area is very bad and is not expected to last more than two or three months in each house. Dayaks say they will buy sago at Dalat as in former years. (5) Penghulu Untol's District, Botany Oya and Ulu Oya.—The crop is reported to be better here, but Dayaks say they will have to go short. Most houses say they can make the supply of padi last out. (cl Penghulu Chendang's District, Pakoh river. —The reports in this river are the beet of them all, and Dayaks seem to think they will have sufficient without unduly stinting themselves. The apparent failure of the crop is attributed to rats, mice and pigs in all districts. The price of raw sago increased again on the figures for last month, the price per passu at Dalat being 58 cents and at the Kut 64 cents. The amount of raw sago exported from the Dis¬ trict increased tremendously during the month, the figures being :— This shows a total increase of 175 1/2 koyans over the total exports for last month. A ship-load of red sand was purchased from a ship which arrived at Dalat from Trengganu via Kuching. This is excellent road material, and has been laid on the Dalat roads. Four motor schooners, five motor launches, eight schooners, and thirty-four bandongs cleared Oya during the month, the total tonnage being 987 tons. At a meeting held at Dalat on 26th it was decided to hold a Regatta on His Highness the Tuan Muda's Birthday, the 8th August next. Permission to hold this Regatta has been applied for. The Rev. Mother Clare of the R.C. Mission, Dalat, left Dalat for Kuching via Sibu on April 20th to convalesce after her recent illness. Visitors to Oya included Mr. and Mrs. J. G. Anderson. Mr. and Mrs. McLaine, Mr. and Mrs. Field, Mr. and Mrs. Spurway and the Rev. Father O’Brien of the R.C. Mission Mukah. The price of raw sago has risen considerably at Mukah, the maximum during the month being 62 cents, and the average 58 cents per passu. It is satisfactory to note that Mukah prices now approxi¬ mate more closely to those obtainable in Dalat and the Kut. Sago prices are now posted on a board in the Telian each week for the information of Melanau producers. The District Officer, Mukah reports that part of the electric wiring in the Mukah bungalow fused late one night owing to defective insulation. Little damage was done, however, since the resulting fire was luckily noticed in time. The demonstration vegetable garden at Mukah is doing unexpectedly well. Crops which have been found to flourish with but little attention are jagong, soya bean, sword bean, and the usual kribang. Forest Guard Awang Kerta reports that he has found timber of sufficient quantity and value in the ulu Balingian to justify the formation of a protected forest. Mukah.

His Highness the Rajah arrived at Miri on the first day of the month. On the following day His Highness proceeded to Baram, via the Kuala Baram Road, accompanied by Dayang Valerie, Mrs. C. D. Adams and Mr. J. B. Archer, Resident, Fourth Division. The party reached Baram in pouring rain and no official landing was made that day. The next day His Highness the Rajah landed. His Highness and party left for Miri again on April 8th, calling in at Bakong for a short while. The night of the 8th was spent at anchor off Kuala Baram, and Miri was reached the next afternoon. His Highness and party left for Kuching on the 10th. Mr. J. P. Baird. Municipal Commissioner, Kuching, was in Miri during the month on Municipal business. The building of the new Government bungalow at Tanjong Lobang progresses. The questions of light, water and roads there are under discussion. The Native Officer, Niah and Sibuti, Tuanku Ahmat, made a tour of the Niah river during the month and reports all well in the ulu. Numerous applications are being received from all over the Stale for Dayaks to move into the Suai, which river seems to have acquired the reputation of an eldorado. Rainfall at Miri totalled 8.76 inches in 11 days. The reports from Sibuti put the Dayak padi harvest at sufficient for two to three months only. The Malays have done better. The following table gives the Miri trade figures for the month :— The District Officer, Miri, reports that the birds- nest industry at Niah appeal's to be failing for lack of support. Only a few collectors arrived at the caves for the last harvest owing to the low price of nests, and not a single trader put in an apperance at the caves. The price offered in the bazaar (Niah) is 10 cents a kati. Traders complain that the duty— a flat rate of $10.00 per pikul—is too high and is killing the industry, and ask for a 10% ad valorem duty instead. The Drewer-in-Charge, Bintulu, reports that the health of the district generally has been satisfactory. One ease treated during the month calls for special mention. A Dayak working for the Sarawak Timber and Trading Co. was admitted into hospital having had bis abdomen pierced by a one-inch pipe. It appears he was pumping out an underground pulley sump, when a spoke of the pulley transmitting about 200 h.p. at 300 revolutions per minute caught the pipe of the pump and drove it right through his body. The pipe was extracted on the spot. On admission to hospital the man’s right kidney and Home intestines were hanging out; these were care¬ fully put back, the wounds were sewn up, and at the time of writing the Dayak is quite, normal and has returned to Oya, after spending three weeks in hospital. The District Officer, Bintulu, records with regret the death of Semut bin Sabit, Tuan Helal, Bintulu, which occurred on April 30th. The Dayak padi, as was thought to be the case, has proved very bad this year in the Bintulu District, and there are likely to be many hungry Dayaks looking for work towards the end of the year. It is hoped that the timber trade will be able to absorb a number of these. The new kampong across the Sebiew river appears to be a success, since out of the 20 lots demarcated there are only 3 left. Several houses are under construction. Ditches and roads were completed on a small scale during the month. The prison demonstration garden at Bintulu is making satisfactory progress, and should supply the prison with vegetables from the beginning of May. The work on reconditioning the land for the Bin- tulu landing ground remains at a standstill. This has been marked out into strips which will cut out most of the bad swamp area, though whether or not this new scheme will materalise is not yet known. The District Officer, Baram, states that there have been reports of another epidemic amongst the Kayans at Long Laput and several deaths are said to have occurred. Enquiries are being made. In view of the very bad crops harvested by the natives this year in the Baram District, and of the consequent hardship that is bound to occur, and since this is the second, and in some cases the third, successive bad season, His Highness the Rajah has authorized expenditure on relief work necessary up to the amount of five thousand dollars. His Highness has personally appointed Tama Kalang Lawai, perhaps better know n as Tama Weng Ajang, the grandson of Tama Bulan, to be a Penghulu in the place of Aban Wan, whose appoint¬ ment ceased at the end of last year. The appoint¬ ment is universally popular, and great things are expected of the new chief. The Kelabit trip has once more had to be post¬ poned owing to the necessity of the District Officer remaining in Miri during Race Week. It is now very doubtful that Native Officer Mohamad Zin Galau will be able to go. Even when discharged from hospital he will be too weak to travel for some months. Most of the natives down to meet His Highness the Rajah on his visit to Baram returned up river on the 5th. The river was high, and M.L. Mermaid made a vain attempt to tow some twenty-five boats. Ten had to be discarded before the fort was reached, and several more were left behind at Mohamad Zin Galan’s house. Dayang Valerie accompanied the Mermaid as far as the first stop, where she paid a short visit to Mohamad Zin Galau, who was ill and only just able to greet her, and then returned to Marudi on foot. During the month work was started on the repairs to the various store-rooms on the ground floor of Baram fort. They were in a very dilapidated con¬ dition with rotten partitions, and do not appear to have been touched for some considerable time. Fortunately a quantity of old serviceable belian planks are available and the repairs will be effected at very little cost. Wan Ali bin Datu Tuanku Haji Drahman has accepted the appointment of probationary Native Officer and has started work in the Baram District. His Highness the Rajah, accompanied by the Dayang Valerie, Mr. J. B. Archer, Resident, Fourth Division, and Mrs. C. D. Adams, arrived in H.H.M.Y. Maimuna on the 2nd. His Highness remained in the district for some days, departing on the 8th. On the way to the kuala His Highness called in at Bakong and visited the premises of the Vanico Timber Company. Whilst in Marudi His Highness attended to many matters and making satisfactory progress, and should supply the prison with vegetables from the beginning of May. The work on reconditioning the land for the Bin- tulu landing ground remains at a standstill. This has been marked out into strips which will cut out most of the bad swamp area, though whether or not this new scheme will materalise is not yet known.

His Highness the Rajah, accompanied by the Dayang Valerie, Mr. J. B. Archer, Resident, Fourth Division, and Mrs. C. D. Adams, arrived in H.H.M.Y. Maimuna on the 2nd. His Highness remained in the district for some days, departing on the 8th. On the way to the kuala His Highness called in at Bakong and visited the premises of the Vanico Timber Company. Whilst in Marudi His Highness attended to many matters and inspected certain of the Government buildings. On the night of April 3rd a display of dancing and singing was given in the fort and a mild disturbance was caused during the proceedings by a conflagration across river. The kitchen of a Malay house caught fire, but the flames were extinguished before harm could be done to other buildings. The District Officer, Limbang and Lawas, reports that no serious crime was committed in his District during the month. A considerable number of Dayaks, chiefly Skrangs, visited Limbang on completion of their harvests. They brought down considerable quantities of rice, padi and vegetables such as intikai, entimun, etc., for the market, and at the same time paid in head and gun taxes. Rubber near Limbang is reported to be '‘winter¬ ing” very severely this year, and this month’s yield of latex is less than usual at this time of year. Mandor Daman and his road coolies completed the Brunei road during the month; this was formerly maintained by various contractors, but tho contracts have been cancelled. The road coolies returned to work on the Panderuan road. Owing to the dry weather experienced recentlv, all roads are in moderately good condition. Semayong, an old Tagal prisoner, escaped from Limbang gaol on Sunday, April 12th, and has evaded arrest so far. This man, who was sentenced to six months’ rigorous imprisonment, had almost completed his term of imprisonment and was due for release in ten days from the date on which he escaped. His escape was a considerable surprise. During the month m.v. Brunei and m.v. Jitra maintained their usual regular sendee between Limbang and Labuan. On Sunday, April 19th, m.v. Subok, a new vessel which is to take the place of the Jitra, called in at Limbang to show the flag, and for general inspection. Mr. Fleming of Messrs. Harrison and Crosfield Ltd., accompanied by Mrs. Fleming and Mrs. York, the wife of the Acting Resident, Labuan, wore passengers. All shippers and consignees were invited to inspect the ship, and refreshments were served on board. The Assistant District Officer, La was and Trusan, reports that Penghulu Tai Langop came down with some fifty followers to pay tax. This was the largest gathering of Muruts in Lawas for some years, and a main was held to celebrate it. Tax is coming in steadily. The Lawas (Sarawak) Estates Ltd., exported 22,400 lbs. of dry rubber during the month. The Chung Hua School at Lawas continues to prosper. One of the teachers has gone to China on leave, and a local man has applied for registration in order to take his place. A Land Inspector was working in the Trusan District for the greater part of the month. Progress in the survey of gardens is satisfactory, but there is still a great deal to be done.

CORRESPONDENCE. [The Editor is not responsible for the opinions of correspondents.] KUCHING, 26th May, 1936. The Editor, , Kuching. SIR, I was glad to see in the last issue of the that someone had taken up the question of "shorts for women" but like "Observer" in his (her?) opening paragraph I do not think the writer goes far enough. Anyone who has acquired sufficient understanding of the Asiatic conception of what is "simply not done" must realize to what extent such costumes let the wearers down, and unfortunately their com¬ patriots also. If strong reasons could be advanced in favour of wearing shorts one might be able to make some excuse for the practice, but only minor benefits can be claimed from the point of view of comfort and these are heavily out-balanced by ethical and artistic requirements. On the subject of shorts for women "Observer’s” remarks should convince any sensible person that the practice is "infra indignitatem" and he might with great advantage have carried hjs advice further. One regrets the practical disappearance of the riding habit and tweed skirt at home, but the great advan¬ tage of breeches for riding and fishing must be admitted. No such plea can be put forward for the exhibition of monstrosities we are treated to on certain nights at the Club, rather the reverse. The last thing one wants when bowling is to have things flapping about ones ankles, and don't the dear things look pathetic. Again, many good reasons could be advanced for playing golf in this locality minus stockings but none in favour of that practice on any other occasion. No person can afford to take liberties with their personal appearance, and surely the dear things realize the immense advantages of nether extremities clad nicely in silk compared with the ghastly appearance of pimply and discoloured limbs. I have only mentioned the dress question so far as it pertains to the gentler sex, but I fully endorse "Observer’s" remarks regarding the sartorial de¬ ficiencies of men. In conclusion I would ask the ladies to take the mature advice of an old hand whose only desire in asking for the courtesy of your columns is an endeavour to replace the somewhat bizarre figures of club and home with attractive and decorative bits of femininity. I am, dear Sir, Your obedient servant, O. MORES. The THURSDAY, JANUARY 2nd. 1936. Marriage. MCLAINE—ENNION.— On 7th December, 1935, at St. Thomas' Cathedral. Kuching, by Rev. W. Shelley, Alan Lynton, son of the Rev. F. McLaine, Mysore, South India, to Sidney Mary Joyee, daughter of Major S. J. Ennion. Newmarket England. Acknowledgements Mr. ONG KWAN HIN thanks all friends and relatives who sent wreaths and letters of condolence and all those who were present at his wife's funeral which was held on the 6th December, 1935. Local and Personal DECEMBER. Hari Raya Puasa was heralded by a salute of fourteen guns fired from Fort Margherita battery at 8.0 a.m. on December 27th. During the morning numerous parties of Malays called on Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee at Astana, and in the afternoon Their Highnesses paid their customary visits to the Datus, accompanied by Mr. R. L. Daubeny. Acting Resident, First Division, and Mr. F. H. Pollard, Acting Secretary for Native Affairs. The Silver Wedding of Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee falls on February 24th, 1936. We understand, however, that the occasion will be celebrated early in January, since Her Highness the Ranee is expected to sail for Europe on January 4th. Mr. P. M. Adams. Resident. Second Divi¬ sion, paid a short visit to Kuching early in the month, arriving on the 1st, and leaving on the 3rd. During the return journey m.l. Rentis, in which Mr. Adams was travelling, was wrecked on a sandbank off Stumbin in the Batang Lupar. An account of the acci¬ dent will be found under “Second Division News.” The many friends of Mr. N. J. Austin, until lately Agent of the Chartered Bank, Kuching, will no doubt be interested to learn that he retired on pension on September 30th. Both Mr. and Mrs. Austin were very popular in Kuching, and we hope that, they will both maintain their connection with Sarawak by turning up at the annual reception and dinner of the Sarawak Association in London. Mr. K. N. Black, Managing Director of the Sarawak Steamship Co.. Ltd., and Mrs. Black left Kuching by the Vyner Brooke on the 12th to go on furlough. We understand that they will not he returning to Kuching, and so take this opportunity of wishing them farewell and a good leave. Mr. Black’s place has been taken by Mr. G. S. Miller, of Mansfields, who is no stranger to Kuching since he acted tempo- rarily for Mr. Black some months ago. Mrs. B. J. C. Spurway and Miss S. M. J. Ennion arrived from Singapore on December 3rd. Miss Ennion. who is Mrs. Spurway’s sister, was married to Mr. A. L. MacLaine, of the Sarawak Treasury, on December 7th. An account of the ceremony appeal's in another column. H.M.S. Lowestoft (Commander A. R. M. Bridge, R.N.), arrived at, Kuala Rejang on December 29th, and is expected to stay there until January 4th, 1936. H.M.S. Lowestoft is a sloop from the China Station carrying a complement of seven officers and about sixty men. Mr. E. O. Bruce, who stayed in Kuehing for a week as the guest of Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee at Astana, left to go on furlough on December 2nd. Films due to he shown at the Sylvia Cinema during January include Nell Gwyn, Phan¬ tom President, It Happened One Night, and Clive of India. Mr. J. G. Anderson returned from fur¬ lough on Decemher 9th. and spent some days in Kuching before proceeding to Mukah, where he relieved Mr. L. K. Morse as District Officer. Mr. Morse, who has been appointed District Officer, Bau, travelled to Kuching with Mrs. Morse in H.H.M.Y. Maimuna, and had a particularly rough passage. Such heavy seas were running that it was impossible even for a barong to clear Kuala Mukah; Mr. and Mrs. Morse and Mr. R. E. Edwards, who had arrived at Mukah with Mr. Anderson, were therefore compelled to cycle across the beach to Ova and join the Maimuna at the Kut. Mr. Morse reached Kuching on the 12th and took over Bau some days later. On December 21st the annual prize giving took place at St. Thomas’ School. Kuching. In the absence of the Venerable Archdeacon Hollis, the Rev. Father W. Shelley took the chair. After a. short speech of welcome to Her Highness the Ranee, who was present, and who had kindly consented to distribute the prizes, the Rev' Father J. Paisley, Act¬ ing Principal of the school, made a most entertaining speech in which he discussed the progress of the school during the past year, and foreshadowed developments in 1936. Her Highness the Ranee then presented prizes and certificates, and the proceedings closed with three very hearty cheers for Her Highness which were delivered with such enthusiasm that they made the rafters ring Mr. W. Outram, who arrived by the Vyner Brooke on December 20th, is at present stay¬ ing with his son, Mr. J. R. Outram, at Bau. We welcome back to Sarawak Mr. and Mrs. G. Kidd, of Tanah Estates, Kanowit, who returned from leave on December 9th. Mr. Kidd left for Sibu by m.v. Rejang the same afternoon, but Mrs. Kidd and Miss Jewel Kidd stayed on in Kuching for a week as the guests of Mr. and Mrs. J. P. Baird. Mr. and Mrs. Kidd had as a fellow- traveller in the Vyner Brooke the Rev. Father V. ("Apai") Halder, of the R.C. Mission, Sibu, who for the past three months has been undergoing medical treatment at the General Hospital, Singapore. Father Halder, who was in the best of health and spirits, left for Sibu on December 16th, and no doubt the strains of Tyrolese yodelling will soon be heard once more on the Island. Father Hal¬ der’s many friends will be delighted to hear that his long sojourn in hospital has had no adverse effect on the celebrated “beaver,” which, if anything, has gained in luxuriance during is absence. We print elsewhere the Report and Balance Sheet of the United Chinese Bank, Ltd., of Singapore. This report. which discloses a most satisfactory financial position, will doubtless be of interest to our readers, since one of the leading Directors of the Bank, Mr. Wee Kheng Chiang, is a well-known Kuching merchant. We understand that Mr. Wee Kheng Chiang is building himself a house at Ka- tong, .Singapore, and intends in future to divide his time equally between Singapore and Sarawak. It is interesting to note that, a sum of over 810,000,000) was received in deposits by the United Chinese Bank in only two months; the Bank opened on October 1st, and the Report is dated December 5th. Mr. D. R. Lascelles, Officer-in-Charge, Oya and Dalat, has teen transferred to Kapit, where he relieves Mr. F. A. Moore, who is due to proceed on furlough. Mr. Lascelles' place has teen taken by Mr. J. C. B. Fisher. Mr. C. D. Le Gros Clark, who was due to return to Sarawak on December 24th, has been granted an extension of furlough owing to an accident which caused serious injury to his knee, and which necessitated extensive medical treatment. The accident occurred while he was staying in Germany. Mr. Le Gros Clark is now expected to reach Kuching on January 20th. Lieutenant-Commander E. V. B. Baker, R.N., late of H.M.S. Herald, is now in England and will shortly be retiring from the Service. A most successful dance was held at the Kuching Residency on the evening of December 28th, Mr. and Mrs. R. L. Daubeny being at home to about seventy guests. Music was provided by G. Solosa and His Race, and the party finished up in the best Race Week style with an impromptu concert held in the bar. Among the guests at this dance was Mr. C. D. Adams, Resident. Third Division, who arrived in Kuching on December 27th, accom¬ panied by Wan Bujang. Native Officer. and some Dayak tuai from the Poi and Ngemah areas. Mr. Adams, accompanied by Mr. H. M. Calvert, Commissioner of Trade and Customs, left by the Maimuna on January 2nd. We hear that Mr. T. M. Griffiths, late of the Land and Survey Department, has obtained a post with a firm of estate agents in South Audley Street, W. We welcome back to Kuching Miss E. S. Andrews. Principal of St. Mary’s School, who returned from home leave on December 16th. Christmas festivities were more than usual¬ ly intense in Kuching this year, owing to the unusual proximity of Christmas Day and Hari Raya. Boxing Day was declared a public holiday, so this meant that the holi¬ days extended from the evening of 24th to the morning of the 30th, with one (nominal) break on the morning of Saturday, December 28th. Most of us were glad enough to see Monday come round again. On New Year's Eve a Fancy Dress Ball was given at Astana to which the whole European population of Kuching was invited. Fancy dress was optional for men but com¬ pulsory for women, and some highly original costumes were seen. The dance was preceded by a dinner to which nearly ninety guests sat down, and the long table on the ground floor of the Astana, which was beautifully decorated for the occasion, presented a memorable spectacle. The dance went with the swing that always characterises Astana entertainments, and our thanks are due to Their Highnesses the Ra jah and Ranee for a very delightful evening. Incidentally, His Highness’ Private Secret¬ ary and the Astana staff are to be warmly congratulated on the excellence of the arange- ments. It is no light undertaking to pre¬ pare and serve dinner for ninety people, and the efficiency of the organization was remarked on all sides. We take this opportunity of wishing all our readers the test of good luck and prosperity in 1936 At the 36th Annual General Meeting of the Sarawak Union Club held on Saturday, 28th December. 1935, the following gentlemen were elected office-bearers for the ensuing year :— President : The Bishop of Lubuan and Sarawak: Vice-President.' The Archdeacon of Sarawak; Hon. Secretary : Mr. Tan Kui Ghoon: Hon. Treasurer: Mr. Chan Weng Yen; Committee Members; Messrs. Kueh Choo Seng, Ee Tiang Loke and C. Mason; Hon.

PROGRESS OF DR. STRONG'S SYSTEM OF SENDING YOUNG NATIVES TO SYDNEY UNIVERSITY. ——— When Lahui Ako, a trained Papuan medical assistant, addressed medical officers from 15 different countries at the Pacific Health Conference in Sydney in September, it was the crowning achievement of 32 years’ work of Dr. Walter Strong, M.A., M.D., B. CH., Chief Medical Officer of Papua. Against much opposition, Dr. Strong in¬ augurated the system of training young Papuans at Sydney University and. later, sending them out into bush villages to supply medical aid to the natives. Over three years, the scheme has proved successful, and the scoffing of critics has turned into real admira¬ tion. In 1906, Australia officially look over the control of Papua and in course of time the existing scanty medical service was re-organised. At first, it was hoped that qualified medical men would be stationed in each of the 16 magisterial divisions, with oue European and several native assistants. It soon became evident, however, that for reasons of finance Papua would have to be content with native medical assistants, working in villages supervised by three or four Europeans, under the control of a Chief Medical Officer. That is the present policy of the Government, assisted by the medical work accom¬ plished by the various mission societies. At first little medical work was done among the natives—doctors being established at Port Moresby and Samarai mainly for attendance upon Europeans. Gradually, as the native population became more settled and in closer contact with white people, native hospitals wire erected at the main centres. There natives were trained as wards¬ men and assistants to look after native patients, and so was laid the foundation of the present train¬ ing system. A severe outbreak of dysentery occurred in Papua in 1912, and Dr. Strong, who had been a Resident Magistrate, was appointed travelling medical officer. By this time he was proficient with Motuan. the most widely understood of the many Papuan dialects, and he conceived the idea of teaching several natives to help him in combating the dysentery outbreak. Under his tuition they slowly acquired a smattering of elementary medical know¬ ledge and rendered useful service during the epi¬ demic. Dr. Strong was appointed Chief Medical Officer during the war period, and, with a depleted staff, relied largely upon native assistants to do most of the work in villages. After the war the tropical disease of yaws became general in Papuan coastal districts, and native assistants were shown how to give arsenicals by intravenous injections. The first Papuan to make injections could neither read nor write, but merely recorded each incision made by a stroke on paper. When, in 1923, a new material (Bismuth Salicylate) was found to be efficacious by intramuscular in¬ jection, and was also of negligible cost, a definite policy was instituted by the Papuan Government to train natives for independent work in villages. Thousands of injections were given per annum, with a noticeable decrease in the incidence of ulcers and other conditions dependent on yaws. Incident¬ ally, side by side with the training in medicine, went education in English, in which the natives made their reports. Senior assistants regularly sent reports to Port Moresby showing the more serious cases treated by name, district, village, age, sex, etc., and with a brief statement of diagnosis and treatment. This system was carried on successfully until 1932. when a more ambitious attempt was made to give the assistants a better medical education. Towards the latter part of 1932 it was felt that while valuable work was being done at small cost, further improvement would be impossible unless the assistants were given some tuition in the sciences upon which medicine and surgery are based. It was suggested that two or three natives should be sent to the Central Medical School in Fiji. This idea, however, was abandoned: four years among strange people was considered too long for the Papuans to be absent from their country. It was finally decided that a number of Papuans should bo sent to Sydney University for a period of six months' training. The Papuan Government readily agreed to the plan. Twelve natives were selected, some of whom were already assistants in the medical department with a practical knowledge of dealing with native patients. Others were new recruits from mission stations. All could read and write Motuan, and had a knowledge of simple arithmetic and English. A preliminary course of six months was under¬ taken at Port Moresby. Their instructions included : position of bones and body organs; anatomical terms: physiology of blood; lung actions; nervous and digestive systems, etc. They were taught weights and measures, and how to use the balance and microscope. In September, 1933, the party was taken to Sydney by Dr. Strong and placed under the care of Dr. Clements, at the School of Tropical Health and Medicine. He revised and extended the work done in Papua and, with the wide resources of the school, was able to enlarge the young natives’ studies, illustrating by practical demonstration and of surgical injuries, fractures, dislocation of bones, haemorrhage, and head injuries. Having passed examinations entitling them to use The letters C.N.M.A. (Certified Native Medical Assistant), they returned to Papua in March, 1931. The students were distributed all over the Territory, each working with two ordinary native assistants, under the supervision of the Resident Magistrates. The system proved a success, and a further party was sent to study in Sydney. In August, 1935, the third group arrived for six months' training. Dr. Strong regards a party of three as ideal to travel among the bush villages. The leader gives injections and other treatment; the second native keeps records in a patrol book and assists the leader. The third member has charge of the equipment, baggage, etc., and concerns himself with the prac¬ tical side of village medical work. Pacific Islands Monthly. We print the above article in the belief that it is of more than merely local and pro¬ fessional interest, since the Public Health policy that has been so successfully pursued in New Guinea is of considerable significance to those interested in the development of other primitive tropical countries. The Principal Medical Officer, to whom the proof was sub¬ mitted, comments as follows :— "As regards rainfall, waterways and other geogra¬ phical conditions Papua resembles Sarawak, but there the resemblance ceases, for its people are of the negritic type, some 30% being cannibalistic. "Dr. Strong is to bo congratulated on his achieve¬ ments among tribes who have but recently been introduced to civilized methods. "His system of tuition and treatment of the natives is in vogue here but on more extensive lines. For instance Sanitary Inspectors undergo training annually at Singapore, and Field Operating units tour the country especially the 1st and 4th Divisions with a Sanitary Inspector or dresser in charge. Where necessary, malarial conditions are studied and drugs administered. Paid vaccinators were found to fee most unsatisfactory, and protection against small¬ pox is now always performed by Sanitary Inspectors or dressers. 18,000 vaccinations were carried out in 1934, and for this year the number to date is 34,000. "It might be of interest to know that the campaign against yaws has been of signal success. The abhorrent deformities and mutilations occasioned by this disease are now seldom met with. In the last 12 years the Medical Department has given over 80,000 injections of N.A.B.” Some comparative notes on Muruts and Kelabits. Bv F. H. POLLARD. Some years ago I was persuaded to write an article on "The Muruts of Sarawak" (S.M.J., No. 13, 1933), in which I ventured the opinion that Muruts and Kelabits had a common origin. Since then 1 have been stationed at Baram and have had an opportunity of becoming better acquainted with the Kelabits, with the result that I am now convinced beyond all doubt that both tribes have a common origin in spite of superficial differences. The two names Murut and Kelabit were not originally used by the people themselves but were acquired. Several theories have been advanced as to the origin of the word Murut, but personally I favour an entirely new one. In both languages the word purut may be translated as brian, though with Kelabits it is not used in this sense, and I have heard it suggested by more than one Kelabit that the word Murut merely means those who give "purut." I have heard no theories as to the origin of the name Kelabit but it is worthy of note that when they first came in contact with Kayans and Kenyahs they were living in the river Labit. and it seems but reasonable to suppose, that the name Kelabit was given them on this account. In physical characteristics and mode, of living both tribes are alike and both have a thorough knowledge of irrigation a knowledge unknown to any other tribe in Sarawak. In outward appear¬ ances, houses and in the giving of "brian" for wives the two tribes are very different; in languages and other customs less so, but I think these differences are easily accounted for. OUTWARD APPEARANCES. (a) Murut men wear their hair long but parted in the middle and drawn back in a knot, whereas Kelabits cut theirs with a fringe and no parting, leaving a long tail behind which is twisted up at the back. This style is obviously borrowed from Kayans and Kenyahs with whom they are in contact. (b) Muruts normally wear a round wood plug in the ear, the plug being variously decorated either by carving or embossing with silver or other metal, while Kelabits wear the copper ring and leopard's tooth or hornbill ornament common to all Kayans and Kenyahs. (c) Murut women tattoo the forearm and hand only while Kelabit women tattoo the calf of the leg in a series of broad chevrons as well. This idea, I suggest, is borrowed from the Kayans whose women tattoo feet and thighs or from the Kenyahs who tattoo the feet only. (d) Kelabit women follow Kayan and Kenyah custom in distending the lobe of the ear with heavy copper rings while Muruts do not. (e) The Kelabit is the more virile as he has the advantage of contact with other virile races from the Baram, while the Murut has been left to himself and has definitely deteriorated. The short skirt and bend head-dress are common to both. HOUSES. A Murut house contains a room with door and walls for each family whereas a Kelabit house contains no proper rooms. There is a wall running longitudinally down the house but there are no walls dividing each family's quarters, though there is a fire-place for each family. There is a door at each end of this longitudinal wall and sometimes one or mere other doors according to the length of the house. Access tn any particular family's quarters is obtained by going through one of the doors and walking through other people's quarters until the desired spot is reached. This is obviously a more primitive type of house than the Murut house, and it is at first difficult to see why in this the Murut is ahead of the Kelabit who has had the opportunity of copying from Kayans end Kenyahs, than whom there are no better house-builders in the country. But there is an explanation which I am inclined to think is very probably true—improbable though it may sound. According to Kelabit custom the women do the courting and not the men. whereas with Muruts and all other tribes the men take the initiative. It was suggested to me by Penghulu Balang Ratu that some man, getting annoyed nt the frequency of his wife's or daughter's nocturnal wanderings, conceived the idea of building a wall. As a result, short skirts being unsuitable for climbing walls, the initiative passed to the men. I cannot help feeling that there is some connection between the courting by women and the wall-less house and for lack of a better theory I am prepared to accept this. BRIAN. Kelabits do not give "brian" for their wives as the initiative is taken by the woman. The courting by the women is presumably a survival of matriarchy, I hough there is no other sign of it in any of their customs. It is probable that this was originally the custom of both Muruts and Kelabits. as I believe it to be quite unknown for a people to revert to matriarchy, but it is not difficult to see that., however the difference may have originated, when once the Muruts had started the idea of the men faking the initiative it is but a short and natural step to the asking of "brian.” LANGUAGE. It is commonly said that the Kelabit and Murut languages are quite different. This misstatement is due to the fact that the accent and pronunciation are so dissimilar that to a person unacquainted with either language they appear to be two distinct languages whereas in fact they are the same. With a slight knowledge of Murut acquired in the Trusan I found no difficulty in understanding Kelabit, which seems to be merely a clearer and better enunciated form of Murut. with fewer sounds put in merely for the sake of euphony. The same difference appears to exist between the Kayan languages as spoken in the Rejang and those spoken in the Baram—Kelabit and Rejang Kayan being far easier than Murut and Baram Kayan. OTHER CUSTOMS. Customs as regards marriage, deaths and omens are similar with the exception of the giving of brian. Kelabits have for years followed the regular Baram fines for matrimonial and other offences and cannot be compared with the Muruts who settle such affairs according to their own ideas. Burial customs are slightly different, the Kelabits sometimes using a coffin shaped like a dragon or buffalo and exposed in the jungle about three or four feet from the ground, whereas the Muruts invariably use a jar. This exposing of coffins is almost certainly borrowed from the Kayan and Kenyah salong, an elaborately carved post hearing the coffin. Both Muruts and Kelabits have the same head- dance and song, but the Kelabits also use a regular drinking song, having probably borrowed the idea from the Kayans and Kenyahs who are the great exponents of these musical toasts. The Kelabits use a very imperfect system of titles taken on the birth or death of children. This is undoubtedly borrowed from the Kenyahs. Another custom common to both Muruts and Kelabits is that of making nabang and kawang as a sign of mourning. A nabang is a cutting made through the crest of a ridge after the manner of a railway cutting. Some hundreds of cubic feet of earth are shifted—a remarkable display of energy. This takes place at the con¬ clusion of the wake and most of the participants are under the influence of burak. A kawang is a rentis about a chain wide cut through the jungle at the crest of a hill or ridge and visible for miles around. This is also a sign of mourning and is sometimes done instead of a nabang and some¬ times in addition. I had noticed nabang in the Ulu Trusan but thought they were merely road improvements till T visited the Kelabit country in the Ulu Baram. It should be possible to trace the movements of the Muruts or Kelabits by these nabang which are permanent indications of habitation and should provide evidence as to where these people made their first appearance. Temunan—monuments to liars—are common to both. CONCLUSIONS. I think that the foregoing notes may be accepted as conclusive evidence that the Muruts and Kelabits were at one time one. and the same tribe. The question now arises, where, when and why did they separate? This it is impossible to answer as there is no evidence available. I think it may be assumed however that the Kelabits were the last to move off as they occur further south than the other kindred tribes, there are even traces of Kelabits in the Ulu Tinjar. On the other hand if they all came in from the south the Kelabits are the original stock, though I think there is more like¬ lihood of their having come from the north. I once thought I had obtained convincing proof of this on hearing that the Kelabits referred to the Muruts as Lun lenour—the people left behind. On investigat¬ ing further I found they called them Lun lenoul— the people who wear wooden plugs in their ears; a useful lesson on the importance of verifying everything.

Flight to Japan. AIR COMMODORE ON OFFICIAL VISIT. 7,000 Miles Ocean Flying. Air-Commodore Sidney W. Smith, Air Officer Commanding the R.A.F., Far East, will make an official flight- to Japan in February with the squadron of Singapore III flying boats stationed at Singapore. The flight will lie the biggest ever under¬ taken by the R.A.F. No British Service aircraft has visited Japan previously, and the round trip of 7,000 miles, flown in formation by No. 205 (F.B.) squadron, will be one of the most spectacular ocean flights in history. The total crew will be 21 officers and airmen. The Japanese authorities arc arranging an official welcome for Air-Commodore Smith and the officers who will accompany him. The outward route will be by way of Kuching, Kudat. Manila. Hong Kong, Amoy. Shanghai, Kagoshima. Tokio and Takyama, or some other place approved by the Japanese Government. For the return trip the Singapore III's will follow the same route to Hong Kong, and then fly by way of Kamranh Bay and Cochin China to Singapore. Squadron-Leader Bladon, R.A.F.

They have followed the tradition of the Southamp¬ ton flying boats which were stationed in Singapore earlier by opening up new flying routes. Recently they went on a cruise to Hong Kong, via the Philip¬ pines. returning via Indo-China. SELF CONTAINED. The Singapore flying boats are Short long range reconnaissance machines, each powered by four Rolls-Royce engines of 560 h.p. They have a maxi¬ mum speed of 145 m.p.h. and a cruising range of 1,000 miles. An automatic piloting device is fitted. The main hull is divided into compartments, one being used as a wardroom by officers, with a chart table for the navigator. Further aft is a compart¬ ment for the wireless operator, and the engine controls. The last compartment is fitted as a galley on one side and a workshop on the other, so that these three compartments make each boat a self-contained unit. —Straits Times.

Until the publication of an article entitled “Achar” (Spoon-bait) in the Gazette of December 1933 drew attention to the excellent sport available in the “ulus" of our rivers, very little interest seems to have been taken in this method of fishing. For the best results with a spinner it is necessary to get well away from the beaten track where fish are plentiful and undisturbed. That is the main reason, probably, why spinning bus been ignored, because the average officer in his travels sees little except the populated areas of his district, and there is normally nothing to take him into the "wilds,” so to speak. Fish are scarce and well educated where he goes, being harried and exploited by every possible method known to the natives, especially Dayaks. To quote an example, recently I fished part of the Pelagus from just above Nanga Eng- kawat up to Nanga Iran,—five miles of really nice water within easy reach of Kapit. I never rose a fish. Later in the day I was informed by the head of a Dayak house in the Iran that the Pelagus had been "tuba-ed” from source to mouth twice within the last five months. There was hardly a minnow left alive, and provided this barbarous practice is not repeated (which it certainly will be) it will take a year at least before this stream has a normal stocking. As a contract, later, when fishing a tributary of the Menyong 'Balleh) far from any habitation and the same size as the Pelagus, eight and a half brace of semah averaging two catties were landed in just under two hours. Fresh water fishing has been almost entirely neglected by Europeans in Sarawak, largely for the above reasons. It is passable that there are some who have tried this sport successful but have said nothing about it. indeed anyone returning from a trip up river who announced to the ring in the Club that lie had shot a rhino would probably get more credence than the man who said that he had caught a 20-lb. empurau on a spinner, although this is by no means difficult feat in the upper reaches of the Balleh when engkabang and ensurai are fruiting. During the past year it has been my luck to fish some excellent water. In May and June I was surveying in the I’ala Wong district of the Baloi, the true right branch of the Lejang about half-way beween Kapit and Belaga. The Bah and the Sama are two streams on the true right bank of the Balni whose headwaters join those of the Tatau and Bintulu rivers. The district is sparsely populated by Punan Bah who do not use tuba, hence fish are fairly plentiful, but educated. The total bag for this tup was twelve-and-a-half brace in ten days’ fishing, of which three days were blank. During the rest of the trip there was no opportunity to fish as the water was out of order. This last con¬ tingency is all too frequent owing to the heavy rainfall of this country. The bulk of the bag consisted of adong, and the best fish turned the scale at about five catties. Both the Bah and the Sama are slow-flowing streams with few rapids; the water is slightly coloured even in normal conditions, and would in England be associated with coarse fish. In August, and September I was in the head¬ waters of the Balleh, the true left branch of the Rejang. This river is Uninhabited above Nanga Putai, and is only visited by odd parlies of Dayaks who go up to work jungle produce from time to time. The Balleh and its tributaries are fast¬ running clear streams with a variety of fish which will take a spinner. The total bag for this trip was forty-one brace in. fifteen days’ fishing, with three blank days. The heaviest fish was a Kaloi of sixteen catties. The best catch was made in the Menyong between Nanga Sabatu and Nanga Entulu in late afternoon while the coolies were making camp. Fishing for just under two hours ten fish were landed averaging live catties each, three kaloi, five semah, one udong and one empurau. Two rods are not essential, but are an advantage. A light single-handed rod of nine to ton feet and a double-handed rod of twelve to fourteen feet, both on the stiff side, will meet the occasion, with any well-known type of spinning reel mounted with fifty yards of undressed coarse line and twenty-five feet of undressed silk backing. A short wire trace with a swivel mounted at either end is better than the usual standard length trace at home. Hooks of all descriptions should be of the strongest; Hardy's Mahseer triangles are recommended, as the fish arc extremely hard of mouth and bend and smash ordinary light-weight hooks. A landing net (tabir) can always be borrowed from any Dayak house. The usual types of spoon-bait kill very well, but the most killing pattern was one locally made from Muntz metal. This bait was in the shape of an arrow and mounted with one treble hook in the angle, the wings being bent out in opposite directions to make it spin. All fish took this lure readily when on the feed. Spoons should not exced three inches in length over all, and smaller patterns should also be carried, since small fly spoons kill well in the smaller streams. When water is too clear and low for a spinner excellent sport can be had by fishing a grasshopper down the runs like a wet fly. When fishing in this fashion advantage should be taken of all natural cover as fish are extremely shy, even in the most remote streams. Conditions yielding the best sport vary. Pish seem to come on the feed at any time between dawn and dusk, and it was noticed on several occasions that when the water was in order and the fish were not on the move the stream was nearly always in spate during the next few hours. Ideal conditions are when a stream is running clear after a flood, or conversely, a slight rise of the stream not enough to colour the water but enough to bring down odd debris and get the fish on the mere. In conclusion a short note on the types of fish caught might not he out of place. EMPURAU. (Leptobarbus hoeveni.) A very hand¬ some fish and a grand fighter. Likes fast gravel streams. Runs up to twenty catties and over, and is excellent eating and consequently much prized by the natives of the rivers in which it occurs. It has nice lines, is reddish-olive in colour and mainly vegetarian in habit, and is in best condition when the fruits of engkabang or ensurai are falling. Takes an all-bronze or copper spoon better than a nickel one. SEMAH. (Labeobarbus douronensis.) The com¬ monest fish in all fast running, gravel streams. Golden olive-green in colour. Takes a bait very warily and always follows it for a short distance when he can. Takes best in fast water where he has not much time to make up his mind, is an excellent fighter and sometimes behaves like a sea trout when first honked. Does not run much over seven catties, and the smaller fish fight better than the heavier ones, which are apt to sulk after their first rush. ADONG. (Barbus sumatranus.) Not a very hand¬ some fish, predatory and extremely voracious. Takes very freely and is not unlike a pike in habits. It is not particularly good eating, but is a determined fighter when hooked and never knows when he is beaten. He has to be treated with respect too, being up to all the tricks of fouling one's line. Readily distinguished by its enormous mouth, pink fins and tail and black vertical bars on the body just to the rear of the dorsal fin. Runs up to eight catties in weight. DUNGAN. (Barbus macrolepidotus.) Much the same as an adong both in colour and habits. KALOI. (Lobotes saravacensis.) A large fish rather resembling a perch. Is not good eating, the flesh being hard and tasting strongly. Frequents deep still water, and according to the Dayaks does not ordinarily take a spinner, being usually caught by "dapping" with a grassshopper. It is a sluggish fish which likes to bask near the surface, and is an easy mark for a. fish spear. When hooked fights well, making a series of strong deep rushes.—B.J.C.S. Curry,—and How to Eat it. BY C. DE S. I have heard it remarked, by more than one European, that a good curry is the best dish in the world. With that assertion I most heartily agree. Perhaps there is no other dish in the wide, wide, world which has so universal an appeal. No one but the Scot really loves his beloved haggis, and it is not everyone who cares for the roast beef of the English, the paté-de-foie-gras of the French, or the macaroni of the Italian. But whoever tastes a good curry will yearn for it again and again, not unlike the prince in the Arabian tale who pined for the Grecian slave he loved and lost. The most fastidious epicure, the most delicate palate, finds in the curry a subtle something—flavour, if you like,— which is unknown to any other dish which the ingenuity of man has devised. It was only the other night that I was watching some Europeans- four of them, to be exact,— crowding round a Malabari street stall and pitching into whole platefuls of rice and curry with evident satisfaction and relish. In parenthesis, let me here tell you that you should always call it "rice and curry," not "curry and rice," as I have heard it termed in this country. "Bread and butter," not "butter and bread," "whisky and soda," never "soda and whisky.” It is like that, you know. The one is a necessary adjunct of the other. You do not eat curry without rice, nor butter without bread, although 1 happen to know quite a few who ran take whisky without soda, or anything else for that mailer. But all this is by the way. As I was saying, I was keenly interested in these gentlemen enjoying themselves so heartily. Perhaps it was not quite the right thing for me to do. But I was amused, even fascinated, by the sight. The fact was. I was in search of rice and curry myself that night. It was pretty late and I knew I couldn't get it elsewhere. When nt last the party left, it didn't require any great powers of reasoning on my part to deduce that nothing nt all was left behind for another customer. The elfish grin of the Malabari told its own tale. I did not go to the stall that night. But the incident left me thinking. The whole thing was so obviously wrong from beginning to end. I mean the manner in which it was eaten. and, for all I know, the manner in which it was prepared. I shall make no apology, therefore, for giving you a few desultory hints on curry and how it should be eaten. Let me tell you right here that I do not pretend to know anything very much about the Indian curry that we are so accustomed to out here. What 1 would tell you is about the Ceylon curry as prepared by the Sinhalese, and which I consider is the curry par excellence. I shall not, I hope, he accused of a national partiality for so extolling the product of my country, for it is also the considered opinion of those who have partaken of both preparations. If you asked me wherein lay the difference, candidly I must confess I couldn't tell you. The spices used are very much the same, except that we, in Ceylon, use a few more ingredients which are absent in the Indian concoction. So also does the Indian use at least one spice which we never use at all Bin for all that there is a world of difference—a difference, in this case, with a real distinction. Give me the Ceylon curry. I say—EVERY TIM E. Curry, in Ceylon, can be traced back to the very dawn of Sinhalese history. How man first came to eat curry is very much like the story told by Lamb as to how the Chinese first came to eat roust pig; but whereas "A Dissertation on Roast Pig" is ex¬ quisitely humourous, the story told of the first curry that was ever eaten has in it something a little vulgar, so 1 desist from giving you the yarn. He that as it may, tradition has it that when Wijaya, Thee prince from the Punjab, and his followers first landed in Ceylon—Lanka as it was then known— in 543 B.C., he was entertained to a curry tiffin by Quennie, queen of the Yakkas and Sagas. Salted wild boar curry it was, and the prince who had never tasted anything like it before, instead of carrying out his original plan of conquest, disbanded his soldiers, and lived on the friendliest terms with The princess whom he later took to wife. (A tip for the Negus. If he has anything as good as a curry in his culinary repertoire to bribe the Italian general with, the world’s history might not be changed after all; and it will save poor Mr. Eden a world of trouble). Another story is told of how, in more recent times, the master of a British windjammer having acquired a relish for curry, was so loath to leave the island that he stayed on indefinitely, eating curry all the time, and how at last, when the day of reckoning arrived, he was obliged to barter his ship in full satisfaction of the curries he had eaten. This story, I fancy, is too good to be true, but it. serves to emphasize how tempting a good curry can be, and to what lengths a man may go to procure it. There is an erroneous belief that there is but one curry and that it is always the same. The fact is there is an infinite variety of it. To mention only a few, we have the dry curry and the hot curry, the mustard curry and the white curry, the red curry and the black curry, the long curry with its thin and ample gravy, and the short curry the gravy of which is thick. Then there is the devil curry which consists of at least three different curries cooked overnight and blended with infinite care. Indeed a more appropriate name for this excellent hotch¬ potch could not have been given, for it has a devilishly fine flavour. And there are a host of other curries for which I don't know the Christian names. Every one of these lias a distinct taste and a flavour peculiarly its own. Then again, each of these changes its characteristics as to taste and flavour according to whether it be fish, flesh, or fowl that is curried. Chicken curry, I find, is a favourite with those to whom this is not a habitual dish, and I shall there¬ fore tell you how yon should set about making one. Here, again let me remind yon that just as it is ever so much nicer to speak of "soiled linen” rather than "dirty linen," so also it is more elegant to say "chicken curry" rather than call it by that foul name "fowl curry." The choice of the chicken is an important factor in the making of an efficient curry. In Ceylon, a cockerel is the rule rather than the exception. Your bird should be young and plump. It should be as yet quite innocent of what, in elegant par¬ lance, we call "sex appeal," but not so young that it may not, tomorrow or the day after, try its wings in a first little flutter of love. That is the bird for this great immolation. Opinion is still divided as to whether it should be tamely taken out of its cage one fine morning, or whether it should not be caught, after an exciting chase, in your back yard. This latter method, if it can claim nothing else for the prospective curry, has at least the advantage of sharpening your appetite for tiffin, and is especially recommended for the fat man with a bulging tummy, and for the lady, too, whom the French¬ man would describe as being en bon point. Having seemed such a specimen (a chicken I mean, not a lady), we send the dear little tiling as gently as possible to its eternal rest. Strangulation is recommended as the best means of conserving the blood. but what with our present day laws and these societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals this method is now quite obsolete. The artist who knows anything about curry will never skin his bird, for there, between the skin and the meat is an oily secretion which should not be lost for love or money. Our next step would be to give it a baptism by total immersion in boiling water, and despoiled of the feathers, which will come off quite easily, it will soon appear before, us for judg¬ ment in all its naked beauty. There is no special method in which it should be chopped up, hut this may be done in neat little joints or in large chunks, according as to whether you are a gourmet or a gourmand. I really don't know how I should advise you about its head and claws. I think it is positively disreputable to cook them in your curry, although my wife will surreptitiously include them, and eat them too, before I can get home. As for throwing away the pope's nose—Good Heavens, No ! That is the chicken's choicest morsel. And now let me initiate, you into the mysteries of that paste -a delicate blending of many spices— vulgarly known as "curry stuff.'’ While on the subject of spices, let me tell you that I have always thought that Bishop Heber could never have eaten a Ceylon curry If be had had that great privilege, I think his Muse would have inspired him differently when he wrote his famous lines. Some¬ thing like this his song would then have been. I imagine : What though the spicy breezes Blow soft o'er Ceylon’s brine Where every prospect pleases And chicken curry's fine. Truly with lavish kindness The gifts of God are strown ; Oh brother! why your blindness? Come, another chicken bone! (Italics are mine). Hut to the subject. The, various spices should be bought fresh. None of your curry powders, if you please. They are an abomination. In this vulgar commercial age when practically everything is so efficiently bottled and canned for your convenience, it is a curious fact that “curry stuff" is one of the few nice things of life that will not lend itself to this bottling process. The paste must always be freshly ground every time yon make your curry, and your grinding stone should be smooth and mellowed with age. I shall not waste your time or mine in attempting to describe the slow rhythmic motion in which yon should run the roller of the grinding stone backward and forward, moistening every now and then the spices with a few drops of cold water so as to form the whole into a fine paste. You can see the process for yourself at the market any day, any morning. Never cook your curry in any other but an earthenware vessel. The one frequently used is somewhat in the shape of a small basin, and in our lingo is called a chatty. I think the Malays call it blanga. It is also important that your chatty should be one that has been in use for several months, one which is black with soot on the outside, whatever colour it may be inside. A new chatty, straight from the bazaar, will communicate to your curry an earthy smell which would be absolutely fatal. The following is a recipe for a short curry, one with a thick gravy which, I am sure, yon will find delightful. Ingredients : 1 tablespoonfill sliced red onions, 4 large pips of garlic (chopped), 2 slices green ginger (chopped), a pinch of ground saffron. 20 dry chillies (roasted and ground), 1/2 teaspoon fenugreek, 6 cloves, (1 tablespoonful corriander seed. 1 tea- spoonful white cummin seed, 1/2 teaspoon sweet cummin seed—all roasted and ground together), 1 tablespoonful ghee, salt. 2-inch piece cinnamon. 2- inch piece rampa (Malay : daun pandan), 1/4 stem lemon grass, a small sprig of curry leaves (Sinha¬ lese : karapincha, Botanical: Murraya Koengii. Butacea), the juice of one lemon, 3 teacups coconut milk (extract of one coconut). Method : Cut the chicken into neat joints, and put them into the chatty with the rest of the ingredients, excepting the ghee and the lemon juice, and boil until the chicken is tender and the gravy reduced to very little. Then remove the chicken from the gravy and fry it in the ghee, pour back the gravy and keep on a slow fire for a couple of minutes longer. Add the lemon juice before taking off the fire. By this time a wonderful odour would have begun to assail your nostrils and you will be all un- conciously smacking your lips in eager anticipation. To my mind this would be just the time to take a good bath—use plenty of soap and water—to open out every one of your pores for the function they will be called upon to perform in the not far distant future. This would be also the time to send your toti* for a bottle of that harmless beverage—toddy. It is cheap—only twelve cents the bottle. It is the next best thing in the absence of Ceylon arrack (the distillation of the coconut toddy), and will prove a fitting prelude. Toddy, by the way. is not a spirit, and I assure yon that you can take a whole bottle of it, or even two, without any compunction. If. however, you like a kick in it. slice a few red onions and a few dry chillies into a tumbler and pour your liquid over it. adding just a pinch of salt to taste. Let it stand for half an hour: drain the. sediment and drink at a gulp. And now yon are ready to eat your curry. But I would have you eat it in the true oriental fashion according to the immemorial custom of the East. You shall, then, discard your pantaloons for a soft arong, and your body shall be bare; or if you prefer to have something on. let it be a singlet or a shirt of the flimsiest material. Indian silk is indicated. Please to do away for once with your plush-backed chair and your decorated table with its damask cloth, its Dresden china, and its Sheffield cutlery. Instead, you squat yourself on a mat. A green plantain leaf cut, into a convenient square will serve you for a most hygenic plate. The rice shall then lie brought in—steaming hot. Muttu samba of the first quality it should be, not the highly polished rice from Siam, so tasteless and deficient in the valuable vitamins. It should have been boiled to a turn so that the grains shall fall through your fingers in a patter, like a heap of pearls, on the leaf before you. each grain a separate entity. As this grade of rice cannot be procured in this country, a good quality Dyak rice should prove a fair'substitute. Two other dishes, at least, must be served with your curry if you would enjoy it with eclat—a fried brinjal -lew and a sweet maldive fish sambal (Recipes on application). Heap your rice in a little hillock and spread the gravy generously all over it. Arrange a few pieces of the meat all round, and also a little of the brinjal and less of the sambal. You will use your fingers, of course. Nothing can be more satisfactory than your fingers for mixing the gravy with the rice to bring the mess to its right consistency. Indeed, a rice and curry eaten with spoon and fork has a tendancy to lose most of its taste and something of its flavour. And now you fall to it with a zeal. Masticate well each mouthful until it would go down the gullet with hardly an effort. Crunch the bone and suck its marrowy juice. It is worth it. And do not hesitate to belch if you are so inclined. To the Westener all this might sound a little gauche, but what does it matter. It is the enjoyment of the curry that matters after nil. For ourselves. I must own, we arc not over squeamish about these little niceties. With about the sixth mouthful there, will begin to exude from your body a slow perspiration. It will not stream down in large beady drops, but would rather be an imperceptible moistening of the outer man. That is the infallible indication that your curry is just right. There is no general rule I can think of as to how much of the rice and curry should be good for you to eat. For myself. I eat as much as I possibly can. until there no room for more, and if I should find some difficulty in resuming my perpendicular posture. I take it to be a good sign that I have done exceedingly well. Drink your water sparingly after the meal if you would avoid an uneasy gurgling in your gastric regions, but you may have your fill sometime later, and you will need it too. One objection to eating a curry with your fingers, I am told, is that it leaves a spicy odour which no amount of soap will effectively dispel. I should have no objection. For each time you stroked your chin or twirled your moustache it would serve to remind you of the glorious repast you have so thoroughly enjoyed. My remarks, however desultory they may be, would certainly be incomplete, if I did not tell you that rice, especially when eaten at mid-day, produces a sort of coma, a langourous drowsiness, which is not easily shaken off. Yield to it by all means, for as your medical adviser will no doubt tell you, an after¬ noon siesta, as he would probably call it, is the most beneficial thing for keeping you fit and prolonging your life in the tropics. And if you should snore- well. that would only be in noisy but unconcious appreciation of the meal you will remember till the end of your days. *Tamil garden coolie. The Deputy Magistrate. By HENRY DEXTER. Jones, A.R.M. of a Government station in the Gulf Division of Papua, had sent for a man who was reported to have given one of his boys a gun. without being in possession of the necessary permit. In due course the delinquent arrived at the station. He may be called Smith. The A.R.M. declared the “Court of Petty Sessions to be open." Smith pleaded guilty. Judgment was pronounced by the A.H.M. : "Five pounds, or fourteen days.” Smith hadn’t a penny, and elected to "lake it out,." He had his meals at the A.R.M.'s bungalow, and was instructed by the A.R.M. to issue rations, and superintend a gang of native prisoners who were doing odd jobs about the station. Three days later, news came of trouble in the Marfula district. It was essential that the A.R.M. should lose no time in getting inland to attend to it. He told Smith to carry on until his return. and left with his policy and carriers. Two days later, a man (Robinson) came in. He had been sent for to answer exactly the same charge as in Smith’s case. Smith, with the correct procedure fresh in his memory, told the new arrival that the A.R.M. was away, but had instructed him to carry on. Smith accordingly held court, and conducted the case quite correctly. Robinson admitted that ho had broken the law, and judgment was given— "Five pounds, or 14 days." Robinson did not possess the proverbial bean; so Smith handed over the issuing of rations to him, and the supervision of the prisoners Smith, ns senior prisoner, took charge. He also took his ease. A few days later, the little steamer under the B.P. flag came along the coast, and Smith decided to call it a day, and left the station, with a feeling that he had been a very good boy indeed. This incident, which is related in the Octo¬ ber number of the Pacific Islands Monthly, calls to mind a chestnut which has been going the rounds for many years. It is alleged to be true, and the episode it describes is said to have taken place to a Sarawak out¬ station. Its exact origin, however, has been obscured by the mists of time, and the story lias doubtless been attributed to a number of other countries in the East. Anyway, here it is. In a certain lonely outstation, the only Europeans were the District Officer and his assistant. Not unnaturally they used to break the monotony of their existence by holding an occasional party, and on one. occasion, having lunched rather too well, they decided to go for a bicycle ride to cool their throbbing heads. As they flashed through the bazaar, a Chinese hawker, complete with his stock- in-trade. emerged suddenly from a side turning; both bicycles collided with him, and the resultant smash was a masterpiece of its kind. The hawker, his stall, the two bicycles and their riders, all flew in different directions; when the irate Chinaman had been soothed, the two Europeans left the wrecks of their machines where they lay, and walked home sadder and wiser men. Unfortunately, though a keen young Sub¬ Inspector of Police happened to be taking the air in the bazaar just at this moment, and since he was out for promotion as well as for a makan angin, he promptly took cognizance of the affair in his official capacity. Ou the following morning, therefore, the smash figured as the first and most important case m the Report Book which he handed to the D.O. This gentleman, in some confusion, called for his assistant, and a conference ensued. The whole thing, of course, was most unfortunate (they said), but there could be no doubt that the impartiality of the law must be upheld. It. would never do, they agreed, for them to ignore an offence which, if it had been committed by a native or a Chinese, would certainly have resulted in a court case and a line. They therefore reluctantly decided Hint there was nothing for it but to proceed with thc matter and. since both were magistrates, it was agreed that each should try the other, with the Sub-Inspector prosecuting on behalf of the com¬ plainant. Accordingly. when the ordinary cases were dis¬ posed of the Assistant District Officer left the bench and took his seat in the body of the Court before his senior. The Clerk of the Court read out the charge, which was to the effect that the accused had ridden a bicycle through the bazaar while in a state of intoxication, and had thereby endangered life and property: the accused pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to a fine of $10 and costs. The District Officer and the Assistant District Officer then changed places. The latter, putting on his most impressive magisterial air, stared severely nr his senior officer, and opened the case by remark¬ ing that he was distressed to find a European in the dock, since such a thing could not but set a deplora¬ ble example to the natives and have an adverse effect on European prestige. When be had finished his little homily, he glanced at the charge sheet, and his eye-brows rose perceptibly. “Hallo, hallo, what's this?" he exclaimed. "I See that you are charged with riding a bicycle while in a state of intoxication and thereby endangering life and property. There has already been one con¬ viction on this charge this morning : this offence appears to be becoming prevalent, and an exem¬ plary sentence must he imposed. You are therefore fined $20 and Costs.” History does not repeat what passed between the two magistrates when they met outside the Court House ; probably because it was unrepeatable. Decline in B.N.B. Population. COMMISSION APPOINTED TO INVESTIGATE CAUSES. We print, below an interesting extract front H. E. the Governor’s address to the Legisla¬ tive Council of British North Borneo of December 9th, 1935. The address was printed as a special supplement to the British North Borneo Herald. For some time past the decline in the numbers of the indigenous population in certain districts of the Stale has caused anxiety; and Government has decided to carry out a thorough investigation into the causes of this decline in numbers. We have been fortunate enough to obtain for the purpose the services of Dr. J. O. Shircore, C.M.G.. who is a recognized authority on this and kindred subjects, and of Mr. G. C. Woolley whose knowledge of the natives of this country is perhaps unrivalled. "Honourable Members may think it curious that I should mention such a subject in the course of an Address devoted almost entirely to economic questions. But, quite apart from any humanitarian considerations, it is obvious that the health of any population is an economic question of prime impor¬ tance. Unhealthy men must be drones in the body politic; while the healthy are at least potential pro¬ ducers. During the past ten years 46,000 cases of yaws have been treated by the Medical Department. That means, economically. that so many thousands of the population have been enabled to produce and to pay taxes who would otherwise have been a liability rather than an asset—an economic fact of real importance to the State. The public owe a deep debt of gratitude to my Honourable friend the Principal Medical Officer and his Department. How great that debt is may he gauged by the fact that the number of out-patients treated in our hospitals and dispensaries has been quadrupled in a decade, from 43,650 in 1925 to 174,899 in 1934." European Wedding in Kuching. MARRIAGE OF MISS S. M. J. ENNION TO MR. A. L. McLAINE. On Saturday, December 6th, at 11.15 a.m.. Mr. A. L. McLaine. Divisional Treasurer. Third Divi¬ sion, was married at St. Thomas' Pro-Cathedral to Miss S. M. J. Ennion, the Rev. Father W. Shelley officiating. The bride was given away by her brother-in-law. Mr. B. J. C. Spurway, and Mr. A. G. Taylor acted as best man. After the service at the Cathedral a reception was held at "The Hill." the residence of Mr. H. B. Crocker. About thirty guests were present, including Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee, and Dayang Valerie. The health of the bride and bridegroom was pro posed by Mr. Crocker in a very neat-speech in which he said that in this life one was so rarely able to see two genuinely happy people that we ought to thank the bride and bridegroom for afford¬ ing us that pleasure. After the toast had been drunk with acclamation, the bridegroom expressed his thanks in a few well-chosen words. The “going-away," which was a hilarious affair, evoked the traditional showers of rice and confetti, and someone thoughtfully attached an old shoe and an enormous frying-pan to the back of the bride¬ groom's car after he and his bride were safely inside; the clatter that this made as the ear drove away was only drowned by the shouts of good wishes which attended the happy couple’s departure. The going-away dress of both bride and bridegroom consisted of shorts and a green polo shirt, and, as can well be imagined, they made the most effective pair. The honeymoon was spent at Sibu Lant, and later in Singapore and Penang. We take this chance of wishing Mr. and Mrs. McLaine all good luck in the future,—if their married life is as cheerful as their marriage, and as great a success, they will have nothing much to worry about. Muda-mudahan umor panjang dan murah rezki! Kuching Amateur Dramatic Society. DECEMBER 24TH. 1935. A certain gentleman, talking in the bar before the rise of the curtain on the fourth production of the K.A.D.S., was heard to remark gloomily that to expect, a high degree of entertainment was to invite disillusionment, since amateur theatricals' were invariably conducted solely for the amusement of the performers, though, he added, this object was sometimes thinly disguised under a cloak of charit¬ able endeavour, it is not recorded whether after the performance his liverish outlook had changed, but there can have been few who left the club on Christmas Eve without the feeling of having passed an interesting and amusing evening. Tn spite of this it must be admitted that, although the K.A.D.S. spared us the sensation of “support¬ ing a good cause" it is doubtful whether our probable reactions were allowed to interfere unduly with the smooth course of production. There were indications of this in the casting, and again, in the way the producers' kindliness occasionally triumphed over their sense of public duty so that they passed small faults of technique which might have been corrected by a little timely brutality; but our chief complaint is against the continued insistance on short plays. Short plays have the advantage, admittedly, of "giving everyone a turn," but they tend to deprive the entertainment of "body" and to cramp the style of the more out¬ standing performers for the benefit of their weaker brethren, and to the distress of the audience. The last three performances of the K.A.D.S. have con¬ sisted entirely of short plays, and have given us more than ample proof that the society Contains some very talented members—when are they to have the chance to give their talents rein? It would be unfair to criticise the first play, J. M. Barrie's Half An Hour, in detail. Whether Barrie wrote it for the stage is doubtful, but there is no doubt whatever that its successful production demands a first class professional cast, and the K.A.D.S. found the difficult dialogue and the crea¬ tion of the necessary emotional atmosphere too much for it. Many people must still be wondering what it was all about. The failure of Half An Hour, however, was brilliantly atoned for by The Unforgivable (the order of the plays was, incidentally, most wisely chosen) which dramatises the joke of the husband who forgives his friend for making off with his wife and his most cherished personal belongings, but is driven to murder when the former is promptly returned to him. The joke is an old one, but Mrs. Gibson and Messrs. Kelley, Harding and Mitchell put new life into it, and we soon found ourselves roaring with laughter, not. as is often the case, at the sight of our friends in fancy dress behaving in an unusual manner, but at the play. Mr. Mitchell as the not too bright young thing. Brown, deserves most praise, but Messrs, Kelley and Harding were both excellent and ran him very close indeed while Mrs. Gibson was convincing in her smaller part. The curtain rises in the third play (The Death Trap by "Saki”) on three officers (Messrs. Kelley, Whale and Benson) who are only awaiting the relief of a royal regiment at the palace to murder their Prince (Mr. Mitchell). The Prince is left alone with his friend the royal physician (Mr. Daubeny) to whom he discloses his knowledge of the plot, and bewails the fact that he must die with so much of life unlived. The loyal regiment is heard marching out and heavy footsteps sound out¬ side the door when the doctor seizes his stethoscope and begins to examine the Prince as the assassins enter. He is ordered to withdraw, but announces gravely that the Prince is mortally ill and has only six days to live. The assassins, relieved, go out, and the Prince turns joyfully to the doctor who tells him, however, that his diagnosis was a true one. The Prince refuses to wait for death, and, procuring a deadly poison from his friend, succeeds, by poison¬ ing a bottle of wine, in taking his enemies with him to the grave. In some ways this was the most interesting play- on the evening. The peculiarly macabre atmos¬ phere which “Saki" creates even in his humorous stories is amazingly difficult to reproduce on the stage, and again we had the players struggling with a task which was almost beyond their powers. They succeeded admirably, however, in holding our interest, and Mr. Mitchell is to be congratulated on a convincing, if rather too restrained, performance. He has a delightful speaking voice, and was perhaps the outstanding figure of the evening. The play gave the other members of the cast little opportunity to create the characters they represented, but they provided an adequate. and picturesque background for the part of the Prince. The uniforms were admirable, though we should have preferred to have seen the royal physician in civilian dross with cloak and beard. Her Highness the Bailee's play. The Merry Matrons, came last on the programme, and. going with a swing from start to finish, brought the evening's entertainment to a fitting close. The play is a light satire on the “mems' " side, not, of the Sarawak Club, of course, but of any club in the Far East, though this did not prevent us from con¬ fidently identifying the characters with Kuching ladies of our own acquaintance; and, had the play itself been less amusing, a good time would still have been had by all. Actually Her Highness had clearly been unable to prevent the milk of human kindliness from mingling with the vitriol in her pen, and by cleverly extracting the worst traits of people here and there and combining them to form a single character, she gave everybody the oppor¬ tunity to say “well, at any rate, that can't be me," and so to avoid the wounds usually associated with the throwing of acid. The plot of the play is only a light frame on which to hang the satire of the dialogue, and deals briefly with the gathering of the vultures before the arrival of a new cadet at some time in the future when, we are told, young men will be scarce. The inevit¬ able climax comes with the arrival of the now cadet wearing the air of one who has lived (and died) and bringing with him a wife, two children and a black amah. Consternation of the vultures. Curtain Mrs. Baird was perhaps slightly the best of a very good cast, but Mrs. Daubeny, loaded with the sins of at least four different people, gave an admirable, though slightly overdrawn, performance, and Mrs. Calvert was excellent. Neither Dayang Valerie nor Mrs. Kelley had quite such good lines as the others, but each in her own way struck exactly the right note, as also did Mrs. Pollard (in silence) and Mr. Blagg. After the final curtain bouquets were presented, to the accompaniment of loud and enthusiastic applause, to Their Highnesses the Ranee and the Dayang Valerie, and so many nice things were said about everybody that it will be a sufficient tribute to all those who worked so nobly behind the scenes to say now that throughout the performance we were never conscious of anything but the scene being enacted upon the stage.—E.M.S. Films of The Month. NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER. Unfortunately, the Sylvia Cinema was closed during the first part of November as a result of the diphtheria epidemic, but it re-opened on the 12th with The Camels Are Coming, a farce which gave Jack Hulbert ample scope for his particular brand of clowning; very good medicine, aud just what we needed to cheer us up. The plot—well, what does the plot matter when Jack's around? Suffice to say that as an officer in the Royal Air Force he triump¬ hantly defeated a ring of dope smugglers after a succession of ludicrous blunders, winning fame and a charming bride in the person of Anna Lee, a most engaging young actress, Good clean fun. Tn The Masquerader. Ronald Colman showed once again what a remarkably good actor he is. He had a most difficult part, and one in which the slightest false note would have meant disaster, since he had to double the roles of John Chilcote, the party lender and future Premier, and John Loder, the struggling journalist. He succeeded, not in showing us the same man differently dressed, but in presenting two entirely different personalities and being convincing in both. The story of the nobody who at short notice has to impersonate a famous statesman and then rises nobly to a crisis is not new. but Colman gave il life and made it genuinely moving; inci¬ dentally. his speech in parliament might well be copied by some of our present politicians, whose delivery is not always up to the standard of their subject-matter. Elissa Landi as Eve Chilcote. the faithful wife of the debauched and worthless party leader, was perfectly east : when it comes to straight' plays of this nature you can put all the shimmering Hollywood stars in the bag as far its at least one critic is concerned.—for charm and real dramatic sense Elissa Landi has them all mid. Halliwell Hobbes gave a first-rate performance as Brock, Chilcote’s butler, and Helen Jerome Eddy was good as Robbins, the down-at-heel lodging-house drudge. Altogether a film worth seeing, and not less so for being preceded by Disney's Three Little Pigs,—one of the best of the. Silly Symphonies, and equalled only by The Tortoise and the Hare, which we saw some days later. And now we come to the anniversary perfor¬ mance. which took place on November 24th. The film shown on this occasion was Gay Divorcee, stalling Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and a better choice could not have been made. It played to packed houses for three days, and no wonder; this is the best film of its kind that has yet come to Kuching. It is a film which every British Producer ought to be forced to see twice daily for the next two years. Somerset Maugham achieved his present lucid anil trenchant prose style largely through coyping out daily in long-hand passages from writers such as Swift. Defoe and Sterne ; there is at least a chance that the continual spectacle of perfectly designed settings, perfect dancing, and superb production, coupled with good acting, slick and witty dialogue, and really tuneful music might eventually move the most unimagina¬ tive B.P. out of the slough of banality in which he is at present sunk. Anyhow, anything that had even a faint chance of succeeding would be worth trying. British producers of musical screen plays wonder helplessly why, after years of subsidies and endeavour, they are still unable to compete with Hollywood in anything but the most restricted British markets; well. Gay Divorcee. will tell them. If they still cannot see the light, then there is no hope for them. Let us surrender the whole of our musical-comedy market to America and have done with it. At least we shall get Entertainment; did you notice the capital E? Gay Divorcee is that rarest of things, a musical comedy in which some imagination has been expended over the casting. Fred Astaire and Ginger Bogers are—well, just Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, but they fit exactly into their roles of the professional dancer who is mistaken for a professional co-respondent, and the rich young wife who is seeking relief from a geological-minded husband. Alice Brady was the ideal choice for the managing and much-married American Aunt (who is there who doesn't know this formidable creature!), and Eric Rhodes struck just the right note of oiliness as the Italian pro-co, as those gentlemen are known in legal circles: whether Mussolini will be flattered remains to be seen. Edward Everett Horton was delightfully inane in the part of the nit-wit lawyer,—he is an actor to watch. The only fault in this splendid film was one to which American producers are all too prone,—over¬ emphasis. But this only occurred at one point, namely during the dance-number "Continental." which was drawn out to unconscionable lengths, so we really cannot grumble. The dancing of Fred Astaire in the other number. "Sight and Day'' was a revelation; what polished technique, what perfect timing, what superb sense of rythm! All other dancers seem like clumsy amateurs niter these two. Having just thoroughly disparaged British musi¬ cal films, it is a relief to turn to the exception that proves the rule. Brewster's Millions. featuring Jack Buchanan. was sheer joy from start to finish. Jack was at his gayest and best, and his best can be very, very good indeed; as a dancer he is the nearest approach to Fred Astaire that we can boast, and his personality is, if anything, even more attractive. But although the whole performance went with a swing, one felt, somehow, that there was a faint but perceptible lack of the essential something in the production; Jack was not adequately supported, for one thing—Lili Damita does not seem the right choice for his leading lady, and the others in the east were undistinguished : one fell that they were merely actors and actress transferred bodily from the legitimate stage with no conception of the fact that the screen is a totally different medium, demanding quite a different technique. But Jack carried the play to success on his shoulders, and took all obstacles in his stride. Definitely a three-star show. Impersonation was to the fore again in Folies Bergèrcs. in which Maurice Chevalier, complete with under-lip. rushed from a Paris music-hall to take the part in real life of the millionaire financier whom he had often impersonated on the stage. Merle Oberon was devastatingly attractive as Baroness Cassini, the financier’s wife, and Ann Southern gave an effective study of Mimi, the guttersnipe termagant of the chorus. An amusing show with a reasonably ingenious plot, and one which held the attention. But what a pity it is that Maurice sings all his songs on one note! Alas! Not all the wealth of Hollywood can graft a musical ear on one who is not so gifted by nature, and there it is. That lip makes up for a lot. Paraphrasing the words of Thackeray, one might almost describe Maurice as being 'Lip—more—lip —and then nothing.! But doubtless his admirers land they are legion) will not agree with this judgment. In A Cuckoo in the Nest, the Ralph Lynn-Tom Walls team hashed up the same old formula once again, and once too often. It may, of course, be wildly funny to watch someone trying to go to sleep under a washhand stand, but after twenty minutes of it the humour somehow begins to pale. And this applies to all the rest of the film. The jokes were not merely rubbed into one,—they were hammered in. beaten in with a heavy mallet until one began to wonder whether they were jokes at nil or merely concentrated agony of soul. Tom Walls drunk for five minutes is amusing; but Tom Walls drunk for two hours on end becomes a weari¬ ness of the flesh, almost ns tiresome, in fact, as the real thing. Yvonne Arnaud did what she could to put some leaven of wit into this soggy mass of dough, but her efforts were foredoomed to failure. Tom Walls and Co. can do a lot better than this. ' Other notable films included Legong, a charm¬ ing picture of Bali acted by an all-native east, and the Last Gentleman which starred George Arliss in a riot of false sentiment and G. Arliss; the two are rapidly becoming inseparable. First Division News. NOVEMBER. Sixty-four civil and sixty-six criminal cases came before the Kuching Courts during November Of the latter, twenty-six were for breaches of Municipal by-laws. Four inquiries into deaths were held in Kuching during November. The first, on the body of a Chinese named Yong Yong Fan, resulted in a verdict of suicide during temporary insanity. In the second, on the body of an Indian named Drahaman, who had inadvertently swallowed poison, a verdict of death from misadventure was returned. The third, on the body of a Chinese girl named Kian Mah Kee, aged seven years, who was knocked down and killed by a Municipal lorry, resulted in a verdict of accidental death primarily due to negligence on the part of the lorry driver. The lorry driver was subsequently charged under Section 304A of the Sarawak Penal Code, found guilty and fined $50.00. $200 compen¬ sation was awarded to the mother of the deceased. A verdict of accidental death was recorded at the inquiry into the death of a Chinese named Lee Kee Jiok, who was knocked down and killed by the Constabulary ‘bus on 15th Novemlmr. Mr. K. H. Digby reported for duty in the First Division on the 23rd November and loft shortly afterwards for the Simanggang Road, where he, is carrying out a census. The Officer-in-Charge, Ban. reports that a case of robbery with violence took place at Pajiru on November 19th, when a Chinese bringing a large sum of money from Dutch territory to Sarawak was attacked by coolies of the Kuching Mine, and robbed of all that he had. The Polite are searching for three men who absconded from the mine on the night in question, and who were almost certainly respon- sible for the crime. Three hundred and fifteen persons were treated at the Bau dispensary and hospital during Novem¬ ber, and one hundred and sixly-seven N.A.B. injections were given. The Dresser-in-Charge, ac¬ companied the Officer-in-Charge, Ban, to Singghi, and then on a four-day trip round the Jagoi locality; needless to say the Dresser's services were greatly appreciated in all the Kampongs visited. If this system of occasional visits by the Dresser to file Kampongs can be maintained, the incidence of yaws, so prevalent at present among the Land Dayaks, should be greatly reduced. The Dahan Rubber Estates, Ltd., harvested 7,580 lbs. of dry rubber during November. The rainfall at Bau was 11.34 inches and at Dahan 17.4 inches. The padi crops appear to be coming on well throughout the Upper Sarawak district. Sennah district, however, report that their padi is again being destroyed by insects ; accordingly, a drum of antidote was sent up by the Agricultural Depart¬ ment and forwarded to that locality, in order to try to save the crops. Painting and overhaul of all bridges on the Kuching-Bau Road were completed during the month. The roofing of the District Officer's bungalow was repaired, and the garage almost entirely reconstructed. The roads have suffered owing to the almost daily rainfall, but it has not yet been found necessary to restrict traffic. The Officer-in-Charge Bau, accompanied by the Native Officer, walked over to Danau (left-hand branch) on November 18th to investigate a shoot¬ ing accident. He returned by boat on the 20th, and owing to the flooded state of the river reached Balu Kitting in 3 1/2 hours, a remarkably fast time. On the 22nd—23rd a visit was paid to Singghi, in order to settle two land disputes. The Singghi Dayaks are extraordinary adroit at re-opening old cases and then disagreeing about the former magis¬ trate's decision. On the 25lh the Officer-in-Charge visited the Tembawang group, stopping at Kampongs Grogro, Setengang, Plandok and Opar, returning to Bau on the 29th. At Setengang there was some trouble over two rival medicine men, who were each accused by their respective antagonists of killing their patients. Evidence was vague in the extreme, and both men were warned that if any further reports of such a character were heard, they would both he expelled from the Kampong. One Exclusive Prospecting Licence, one Pan¬ ning Licence and two General Prospecting Licences were issued in Upper Sarawak during November. The total output of gold for October was 2,042 ozs. The following table shows the individual out¬ put of gold from the various mines for the month of October :— Two bundled ami fifty-eight logs of kruin wood were shipped to Kuching from Lundu during November. The District Officer, Sadong, reports that a Chinese named Lai Chin was sentenced to one year's imprisonment under section 428 of the Penal Code for wilfully destroying the roots of 500 pepper vines belonging to one Lai Siting Hin, of Serian. Apparently Lai Chin's wife preferred Lai Siong Hin's company to that of her husband, who took this means of giving vent to his jealousy. One Chinese from the Ulu Sadong, and sixteen Samarahan Malays were prosecuted and fined, for tapping during the recent tapping holiday. On November 30th a Sea Dayak named Sulow, of R. Sampa, Sebangkoi. Ulu Simiinjan. com¬ mitted suicide by shooting himself. The Dresser and corporal-in-charge immediately proceeded to the Ulu to investigate. Sarawak Union Club. A SUCCESSFUL EVENING FUNCTION. A reunion dinner of the members of the Sarawak Union Club was held on Saturday night the 21st December, 1935, St. Thomas’ Day. The Club premises were beautifully decorated for the occasion and 62 members and their friends were in attendance. After proposing the least of His Highness the Rajah, Mr. Tan Sum Guan, who presided, said it was most regrettable that both the President, Bishop Hudson, and the Vice-President, Arch¬ deacon Hollis, were unable to join them, the former being still away in Europe on furlough and the latter being unavoidably prevented from attending due to some important ecclesiastical work. He said that the Club was instituted in 1899 and is therefore 36 years old this year, and that like a human being the Club needs food to keep it going. This food must he provided for by the members by way of finance. He pleaded for whole-hearted support of the members in this direction and hoped the Club would continue to prosper in the future. The next speaker was Mr. Tan Soon Tye. who in his speech, referred to the praiseworthy manner in which the Management was conducted, together with the many privileges afforded by Ilie Club, to which Mr. Tan Kui Choon, Honorary Secretary of the Club, suitably replied on behalf of the Committee. Before the meeting dispersed, Mr. Tan Sum Guan presented the Cups and Medals to the following winners of the Tennis and Billiards Tournaments held during the year :— After the dinner, the members indulged in Billiards, Mahjong and a concert from the Club's wireless Receiver and Radiogram. The gathering was of a very cheerful and sociable character, and the function was a great success.—(Contributed). Tennis. MEN’S HANDICAP SINGLES. First round.—Cargill scr. beat Whale +15, 6-2, 6-2.

NOVEMBER, On November 12th the Resident, Second Division, left lor Saribas and Kalaka in order to accompany His Highness the Rajab on his visit to those districts. He returned to Simanggang on November 16th. Two Dayaks from Kantau, N.E.I., who were travelling without passes in the Undup, were each sentenced to two weeks' imprisonment at Simang¬ gang. Tuai Rumah Bunyau appealed against the decision given in the District Court, Simanggang, about a farming land dispute. The Resident's Court upheld the decision of the Lower Court, but Bunyan now wishes to appeal to the Supreme Court. 175 out-patients were treated at Simanggang Government Dispensary during the month, and 95 N.A.B. injections were performed.

The Resident has taken this matter up with the Dutch authorities. 133 out-patients were treated at Betong Dis¬ pensary during November; 35 N.A.B. injections were administered. The general health of the district was good. Sarawak Union Club. A SUCCESSFUL EVENING FUNCTION.

The Resident has taken this matter up with the Dutch authorities. 133 out-patients were treated at Betong Dis¬ pensary during November; 35 N.A.B. injections were administered. The general health of the district was good. The District Officer, Saribas, reports that a con¬ siderable crowd of Dayaks visited Belong during November in order to welcome His Highness the Rajah. In spite of the tapping holiday and a poor harvest, natives in the Saribas district appear con¬ tented and comparatively prosperous. Applications to move from Ulu Spak and Layar, however, have been numerous. On November 28th Abang Draup. Native Officer, travelled up the Layar to investigate reports of food shortage, and to offer Government assistance in cases of genuine distress. His Highness the Rajah arrived at Betong on the afternoon of November l2th. His Highness was accompanied by Mr. P. M. Adams, Resident, Second Division, Mr. R. L. Daubeny, and Mr. D. C. White. Acting District Officer. Kalaka. After making an official landing His Highness attended a Dayak football match. In the evening His Highness received Pengbulus and leading Tuai Rumah at the District Officer’s house. On the following morning His Highness the Rajah went to the Fort, where he was received by a guard of honour and representatives from the Malay. Dayak and Chinese communities, the roads being lined with children from the various schools. After granting numerous interviews, His Highness left the Fort and called at a Malay school. His Highness then visited the Chinese school, where refreshments were provided; a speech of welcome was made by the Kapitan China, and the Head¬ master then proposed His Highness' health, which was drunk by all present. Tn the afternoon His Highness the Rajah paid a visit to the S.P.G. Mission His Highness the Rajah and party then left Betong in M.L. Rentis. In honour of His Highness the Rajah's visit, to Betong. a Saribas Dayak football competition was held, eight teams entering for the cup presented by Chop Seng Lee. Play during the earlier rounds was energetic and most interesting to watch. The match particularly deserves mention, when Stambak Hi. who had drawn with Bangat on three successive days, finally won by the odd goal, the score being 1—0. From start to finish the match was most evenly contested, and in the opinion of the local experts, although Stambak deserved to win, Bangat were unlucky to lose. It is to be regretted, however, that after the match Bangat lodged an objection. It appeared to the Committee that Stambak Ili's conduct wns objectionable, but the objection was overruled on a technical point. The District Officer, Kalaka, reports that the prospects of a satisfactory padi crop in his district are good. Swamp padi in particular appears to be doing well. No breaches of the tapping holiday were rported in the Kalaka district. The District Officer left on the 18th for Roban via Engkabang to investigate reports made to His Highness the Rajah that a number of Dayaks were starving. He visited the Seblak, Mudong, Ibus and Roban, and reports that although the Dayaks are certainly on short commons, the majority appear quite capable of providing for themselves and their families. About fifty or sixty doors con¬ sisting mainly of widows, orphans and cripples appear to lie in genuine distress, and sago will be distributed to them. His Highness the Rajah, accompanied by Mr. P. M. Adams and Mr. R. L. Daubeny, arrived at Kabong on the morning of November 14th. His Highness went ashore at 9 a.m. and listened to requests in the fort followed by an address delivered by Malay schoolboys. H.H.M.Y. Maimuna left for Saratok in the afternoon arriving at 5 p.m., but the official land¬ ing was delayed until the following morning. His Highness the Rajah on landing proceeded to the fort, the road to which was lined with Malay, Chinese and Mission schoolboys, and then sat in Court granting interviews and hearing requests. His Highness also visited both Chinese and Malay schools, where addresses of welcome were read, and after a stroll through the bazaar returned on board H.H.M.Y. Maimuna, which sailed at 1.30 p.m. The District Officer, Lubok Antu, reports that in most cases padi crops in his district show an improvement on last year, the crops in the Ulu being particularly excellent. The Telaus people, however, who only finished planting at the begin¬ ning of November, are obviously in for another famine in 1936. Towards the end of November Abang Abu Talip, Native Officer, was sent up river with instructions to bring down Penghulus and Tuai Tuai to Lubok Antu for an aum on various mints. This he did, returning ou November 30th. The Native Officer, Engkilili, reports that a Dayak named Badin, of rumah Enchirong, Stengin. Lemanak, whose wife was taken by a crocodile while fishing some months ago, brought in a crocodile measuring 6 feet 11 inches. This beast is alleged to have been the one that killed bis wife. With the exception of a few minor cases of illicit tapping, the tapping holiday appears to have been loyally observed throughout the Engkilili district. On November 17th m.l. Sin Kim Suah was holed by a submerged stump near Emplam while on her way to Engkilili. and nearly sank. Fortunately, however, her crew succeeded in stopping the leak, and the launch arrived at Engkilili late the same evening. M.L. “Rentis” Wrecked. ACCIDENT IN BATANG LUPAR. When returning from Kuching to Simanggang with the Resident. Second Division, M.L. Rentis was wrecked on a sandbank below Stumbin in the Batang Lupar. The accident occurred at about 9.30 p.m. on December 3rd. The subsequent inquiry revealed that the wreck was chiefly due to a miscalculation of the tides, which are notoriously tricky in the Batang Lupar. There was a bright moon, and although the river is about three-quarters of a mile wide at the point where the accident took place, both banks were clearly visible. Soundings were being taken at the time and showed that the. water was becoming increasingly shallow: growing alarmed, the Jura- gan rang the engine-room telegraph to “slow,” and prepared to let go the anchor. He then put the helm hard over in order to go about, but it was too late,—the launch struck a sandbank broadside on and heeled right over. The Resident, who was down below in the cabin, had the greatest difficulty in climbing out mid getting onto the up¬ turned side of the boat. which was the only refuge available. There were a number of women aud children on board who were placed in the ship's dinghy, and who, accompanied by one man, safely reached the shore some way upstream. For¬ tunately, a boat, appeared on the scene with a village constable, who was on his way from Lingga to Simanggang, and the remainder of the crow and passengers were taken off; just how opportune was the arrival of this boat will be seen when it is realised that a current estimated at twelve knots was running, and the water was rapidly rising. The Resident arrived at Simanggang about 11.15 p.m.. and accompanied by the District Officer, immediately returned to the scene of the wreck with two Chinese launches, the Chin and the. Yong Huat Heng; by this time the Rentis had been swept about a mile upstream by the extremely strong current, which rolled her over and over, smashing all the skylights, awnings, bridge, and decking, and which eventually carried her onto a sand-spit opposite Kuala Grau about, fifty yards from the shore at high-tide. Ropes were passed around the wreck, and when the tide made an effort was made to beach her closer to the bank, but little could be done owing to the continual breaking of ropes. It was not found possible to manoeuvre the Chinese launches into a position from which they could tow, but they stood by and assisted by lending gear. Capt. A. W. G. Gibson, Surveyor of Ships, left Kuching in M.L. Betty shortly after receiving news of the accident and arrived on the scene of the wreck at mid-day on December 5th; salvage operations were commenced as soon as the tide receded. The hull, which unfortunately had again turned turtle, was re-floated at 11.0 p.m., and a start was made to tow it to Simanggang. At Sembauh. however, the ebb tide became so strong that no further headway could be made, and M.L. Betty anchored at 2.30 a.m. on December 6th. After half-an-hour both anchor chains parted; the spire anchor was let go, and the engine was run at full speed ahead in order to prevent the Betty and her tow drifting downstream. Eleven hours later the Betty was able to proceed upstream with the flood, and Simanggang was safely reached the same afternoon. The hull of the Rentis was put into Sungei Simanggang on arrival, and during the next few days she was patched up by a party working day and night: it was essential to complete the repairs in as short a time as possible, since owing to the bore, Sungei Simanggang would only have been safe for a few days. M.L. Betty left Simanggang with the hull of the Rentis in tow and reached Kuching on December 10th. The hull of the Rentis is now in Brooke Dock undergoing repairs which are estimated to take about three months. Third Division News. NOVEMBER. Thirty-five civil and thirty-seven criminal cases came before the Sibu Courts during November. Owing to an epidemic of mumps, the Govern¬ ment Malay School and Chinese schools were closed during the month. In the circumstances it was not possible to hold the annual examinations in the Malay school, and these will have to wait until after the Bulan Puasa holidays. The following table gives the Sibu and Kanowit trade figures for the month :— The construction of the new Sibu floating wharf was completed during the month. Owing to high floods, however, work on the groynes near the waterworks was delayed. Work on the concrete columns of the new police barracks. Karnpong Pulau Road, was completed during the month, and earth filling on the site is now in progress. About fifteen tons of belian timber for these barracks is still in Bintulu await¬ ing shipment. In accordance with the Local Order that, comes into force on 1st January. 1936. wheels of Govern¬ ment hand-carts were changed for car wheels with pneumatic tyres. The cost of this works out at about $143 for each cart. This seems expensive, but should be amply justified by saving of road surfaces. The Clerk of Works visited Binatang to effect repairs to the Customs godown and to fix iron ladders to the wharf; he went on to Sarikei to remove the wharf sluice to a new position, and then to Daro to make drawings of the Court house and quarters. The Lee Hua Sawmill received an offer from the United Timbers (Bintulu) for timber of Merunli er Geronggong types. An average width of 8 1/2 was asked for, which is considerably lower than the previous averages. This offer is under consideration. Three Tuai Rumah from Pala Wong, Tama Samunau, Gonnori, and Lanyong visited Sibu during the month in connection with the Bah-Sama Protected Forest. Tama Samunau asked for an excision of damun from the protected area on the true left bank of the Sungei Bah. The request was referred to the Resident, who refused it on the grounds that there was sufficient land available on the true right bank of this stream. These three houses will have the right to work rattan and wild sago and collect fruit, in addition to the usual rights available to natives in protected areas of this nature. The Resident approved the final constitution of both the Bah-Sama and Menyong Protected Forests. During the month sample jelutong plots 6 (Daro Forest Reserve) and 12 (Bukit Lan Experimental Plantation) were both measured. Sample plot No. 12 showed encouraging increases in both girth and height. One hundred and forty patients underwent treat¬ ment in Sibu Hospital during November. This number included ninety-nine cases admitted during the month. Discharges were ninety, and one patient was transferred to Kuching; at the end of the month there were forty-three patients in the hospital. Out-patients numbered five hundred and twelve, two hundred and twenty-seven of these being new cases. Thirty-four N.A.B. injections were given. Owing to the diphtheria epidemic in Kuching, all passengers from this port were, medically examined on arrival. Propaganda concerning diphtheria in the form of circulars in English, Malay and Chinese, was circulated and displayed in the bazaar. All European officers, their families, and certain members of the Junior Service were innoculated with antitoxin. The Divisional Medical Officer, in connection with the diphtheria epidemic, paid four visits to Sarikei and one to Kanowit. Since 28th Novem¬ ber no new cases have occurred. At the time of writing only three cases remain at the isolation camp. During the month Native Officer Abang Indih toured the Pasai district, collecting gun and head tax. On November 1st the property of Messrs. John Reid & Co. at Kanowit was sold by public auction. Almost the entire mill outfit was bought by Messrs. The Borneo Company, Ltd., who are now pro¬ posing to operate this sawmill. Messrs. Skinner and Cameron, formerly employed by Messrs. John Reid & Co., are now in the employ of Messrs. The Borneo Company, Ltd. The mill is waiting for a set of new saws before commencing operations. On Armistice Day at Sibu the Two Minutes' Silence at 11 a.m. was marked by guns fired from the battery. All Europeans and representatives of the various communities were present al the flag¬ staff during the Silence. A guard was furnished by the Constabulary under the command of Inspector Mohd. Yan. Mr. R. G. Aikman and Mr. C. S. Sergei arrived at Sibu on the 1st in connection with the rubber census. After visiting upriver stations they pro¬ ceeded to Matu and Daro. A considerable number of the census forms were found to be incorrectly or carelessly filled in. and special arrangements were made to have these checked and corrected. A number of Dayaks from Pasai district were found to have planted rubber in contravention to the Rubber Res¬ triction Order. Action is being taken against them through the Courts, and the rubber is being destroyed. Information was received from Kapit that the great pig migration had ceased; later in the month, however, it recommenced, and numbers of Dayaks applied for permission to proceed up river. Six bead of buffalo arrived from Kuching on their way to Kanowit. These have been bought by Kanowit Dayaks for agricultural purposes. The District Officer, Sibu, mentions that it may be of interest to record a newly-coined Dayak word Rejap, which means a 'levy.' This is alleged to have originated from the word 'reserve.' which was used before the word ‘levy’ was instituted. This word is now in common use both in Sibu and Kanowit districts On November 23rd an inquest was held at Binatang on the body of a drowned Chinese girl, a verdict of accidental death being returned. On the 28th an inquiry was held into the death of a small Chinese child suspected of having been poisoned; the body was sent to Sibu for post-mortem examination, when it was found that death had been caused by a fracture of the skull. A verdict of death by misadventure resulted. There was little crime in the Lower Rejang district during November. A smuggling case was heard at Binatang, when a fine of $2,400 was imposed by the Resident, and matches to the value of $810 confi¬ scated. There was a slight outbreak of diphtheria in Sarikei during the month, four cases being dis¬ covered. The patients were isolated from the 8th to the 23rd, and there was no further outbreak. The cinema and schools in the bazaar area were closed from the 9th to the 27th, and no hawking was allowed during the same period. The Divisional Medical Officer arrived at the district four times during the month. In the course of the month all Dayaks in the whole of the Sarikei district were visited. All was found well, and there no complaints; the padi crop promises to be better than last year. The District Officer, Lower Rejang, reports that the tapping holiday was successfully carried through in his district and there were no eases of illicit tapping. Pepper was still at a very low price, and several of the larger towkays are storing up stocks in the hope of better times. The following figures show the export returns for Sarikei :— Repairs to Jakar Road from the 2nd mile towards the 3rd mile were earned out by prisoners, who finished about 600 fathoms. The contract for repairing three miles of the Jakar Road was almost completed, with the exception of gravelling. A con¬ tract for the supply of 100 cubic yards of earth for filling the back lane behind new shophouses in Repok Road was completed, and gravelling was also carried out. A new contract for the reconstruction of the Boban Road was made during November, and work is in progress. Mr. F. L. G. Crossley took over the Lower Rejang district on November 29lh from Mr. A. Macpherson, who left for Sibu on transfer on the 30th. Mr. E. M. Selous, Acting Secretary for Chinese Affairs, arrived from Sibu on the 19th. proceeded to Selalang on the 20th, and returned to Kuching direct from Rejang on the 21st. The Divisional Forest Officer visited Daro on the 25th and 26th for the purpose of inspecting Tanjong Belatok Reserve. The District Officer. Kapit, reports that the Punan Bah brought down some of their logs to Kapit during November, but it is understood that they still have over 200 logs ready cut in the Ulu Bah, but not yet floated into the main stream. A great deal more block rattan was also brought down by them. A large quantity of rattan came down during the month. and the Chinese shopkeepers are buying up belian posts and planks from Dayaks to repair their shophouses both at Kapit and Song after the recent floods. Awang Badar and Kee Boon, two traders from Beluga, brought down to Kapit over 150 piculs of damar, and about 10 piculs of rubber. They are still in Kapit, being unable to return owing to high water. Native Officer Abang Aboi left for Kaki Wong on November 1st by outboard, returning the same day. He ordered back hundreds of downriver Dayaks who had overstayed their time limit in this district. The Agricnit oral Inspector at Kapit on November 28th, and left on 80th. He reported favourably on ho per and tobacco crops, but it appears that the Chinese are planting the wrong type of coffee. The Officer-in-Charge, Oya and Dalat. reports that two more cases of buying rubber without a licence resulted in fines of $40 and $20. In the Kut and Bungan areas this offence is becoming in¬ creasingly common. The increase in the number of Sibu Foocbows buying rubber without licences in the Igan is caus¬ ing some trouble. In all cases dealt with so far rewards have been given to informers, and T.K. Tawan of Kut is by way of being the most capable Tua Kampong of the district, so it is hoped to put down these offences. Seruni, the widow of the late T.K. Alek of Dalat, died on November 4th. She was the best known Liko woman on the river, and lived to a great age. The last few months of her life were chiefly occupied with payun ceremonies as a means of rejuvenation; the river has lost a real character. I'engliulu Untol was down from the Ulu Ova during the month, and reported that so far as he knew the tapping holiday had been faithfully observed in his district. He accompanied the Officer-in-Charge to the Ulu. Dayak padi and jagong in the Ulu Oya are doing well, but rats are causing considerable damage. The price of raw sago was steady at 68 cents per passu in S. Kut at the end of the month. Dalat bazaar is active as a result of the consistent high price of sago. Much engkabang was brought down during November, the average price being $2.50 a picul. Many Dayaks sold their engkabang for considerably less up river, some as low as 50 cents a guni, but they only have themselves to blame for this. The rubber tapping holiday, as far as could be ascertained, was faithfully observed, and almost all rubber slocks were cleared out of the district. Dur¬ ing the holiday a village constable was on patrol in the Klid district, and another in the Kut; other parts of the district were also inspected. 124 koyans of raw sago and 120 piculs of engka- bang left the Oya district by sea during November. Only moderately rough seas were experienced off Oya during November. A barong capsized when crossing the bar, but this is reported to have been due to the steersman’s fault. No lives were lost, but die day's cutch and most of the barang disappeared. The Officer-in-Charge, Oya and Dalat, reports that during a visit to the Ulu a case of sangka ulun was settled, resulting in a fine of half a picul. The offence was committed during a begawai at Rumah Kedit. the injured party coming from Rumah Tugang and the offender from Rumah Unya. Aparently there has been bad blood between these houses for some time, and according to reports it was only a miracle that a free fight did not develop. There also occurred in this house a case of the comparatively rare offence of selabat. The com¬ plainant had come overland with T.R. Tadong from Sg. Sangkabang Paku: the offender admitted stealing complainant's sirat, and exchanging mutual curses in the subsequent dispute; within a few days the complainant's son, age about eight years, died; accused was mulcted in the usual fine of 15 mung- kols, one-third of which reverted to Government. The District Officer, Mukah, reports that on October 8th a Melanau woman while returning by boat from the Mukah bazaar about 11 a.m. died suddenly at Laut Tutus, apparently of heart-failure. A slight increase in the death rate has taken place at Mukah. this apparently being usual on the advent of the landas weather. 1.3 N.A.B. injections were given, and 97 persons were treated at the Government Dispensary during October. Bunsu, who killed his father apparently acci¬ dentally and then attempted to commit suicide, is still living and appeared in Mukah. He cannot yet speak coherently, but is recovering rapidly. Buckshot and pieces of splintered bone are still working out of his head and face, and his recovery is little short of miraculous. Further inquiries into the matter are still held up pending the time when he will be able to talk properly. On October Sth crocodiles measuring respectively 15' 9" and 11' were brought up to Balingian kubu ; in the stomach of the larger one were found the remains of the boy taken in Kuala Balingian on September 29th. The residential lots behind the bazani at Mukah have now been surveyed. Allocations have been made by the Survey Department, and the price of compensation has been fixed on the houses in front of the bazaar. Work has already started on the demolition. The scheme has apparently been accepted by the bazaar people as a sound pro¬ position. On October 9th Mr. T. E. Parker, Settlement Officer, Land and Survey Department, arrived at Mukah in connection with land settlement, and returned to Sibu via Oya on the 13th by way of the beach, ML. Leonora proceeded to Oya with the barang and some of the Survey staff. In connection with land settlement it is worthy of note that T. K. Eward of Sungei Tellian Ulu has cooperated with exceptional keenness and has been, and still is, of great help both to the Assis¬ tant Superintendent of Lands and Surveys, and also to the Acting District Officer in probate matters. He has a very sound knowledge of the working and objects of land settlement, and already can read survey sheets. All Dayaks are busy on their farms in the Mukah district, and there is little of interest to report from that quarter. Complaints about Penghulu Umpoh are many; he will not visit bis people unless called, and in the casc of the Selangau Dayaks he has been called many times; in fact it must be some years since he has visited this area. An adverse report was given on this Penghulu in 1934. and it is probable that he will have to be relieved of his authority in the new year. A part from this, the Dayaks as a whole appear to be reasonably contented, although they are worried about their farms. Unveiling of a Tablet to the Memory of the late Rev. J. M. Hoover. CEREMONY AT THE EPWORTH LEAGUE METHODIST CHURCH, SIBU. The unveiling of a tablet presented to the Epworth League Methodist Church, Sibu, by His Highness the Rajah, in memory of the late Rev. J. M. Hoover, took place at 11.30 a.m. on December 4th. A Guard of Honour, furnished by the Sibu detach¬ ment of the Sarawak Constabulary, and under the command of Mr. R. G. Talbot, took post opposite the left-hand side of the main door of the Church, where the tablet is situated. A large crowd, which included all the Sibu Europeans and representatives of the Chinese and Malay communities, was present to witness the ceremony, which was performed by Mr. C. D. Adams, Resident, Third Division. On the arrival of the Resident, who was accom¬ panied by the District Officer, the Guard sloped arms; the Resident then made a short speech in the course of which ho said that there was no need for him to say very much about Tuan Hoover; those who knew him personally would keep his memory in their hearts, and those who followed him Would know him in his achievements,—surely man’s greatest monument. He then proceeded to unveil the tablet, which was covered by a Sarawak flag. The Guard presented arms, and, after a short pause, sloped arms and marched off. The tablet is made of bronze, seated on a concrete easting, and is inscribed as follows IN MEMORY OF JAMES MATTHEWS HOOVER FIRST MISSIONARY OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH TO WORK IN SARAWAK 1903 — 1935. THE REV. J. M. HOOVER ARRIVED AT SIBU IN MARCH. 1008. AND WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTLING THE FIRST FOOCHOW COLONY IN THE REJANG RIVER. IN 1904, HIS HIGHNESS SIR CHARLES ANTHONY BROOKE, G.C.M.G., SECOND RAJAH OF SARAWAK, OFFICIALLY APPOINTED HIM THE HEAD OF ALL THE SARAWAK FOOCHOWS, ENTRUSTED HIM WITH THE1B WELFARE, AND MADE HIM THEIR OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE IN ALL THEIR DEALINGS WITH GOVERNMENT. FROM THEN UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH ON 11TH FEBRUARY. 1035. MIt. HOOVER LOYALLY FUL¬ FILLED THIS TRUST. THIS TABLET IS ERECTED BY HIS HIGHNESS STR CHARLES VYNER BROOKE, G.C.M.G., THIRD RAJAH OF SARAWAK, AS A MARK OF APPRECIATION OF HIS UNFAIL¬ ING LOYALTY AND DEVOTED SERVICES TO THE STATE. AND AS A TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF A PERSONAL FRIEND. Attractive in its simplicity, the tablet stands as a lasting memorial to the life and work of one who was a true friend of Sarawak.—(Contributed.) Fourth Division News. NOVEMBER. His Highness the Rajah, accompanied by Mr. E. O. Bruce, Acting Resident, Fourth Division, and the District Officer, Miri, made a tour of the Miri bazaar on November 1st. His Highness left for Kuching by M.V. Marudu the following day. Mr. J. B. Archer, Resident, Fourth Division, arrived at Miri from furlough on November 13th, and look over the Division from Mr. Bruce on the 18th. Mr. Bruce left ou November 22nd to go on fur¬ lough accompanied by Mr. K. II. Digby, who was on transfer to the First Division. There was no serious crime in the Miri district during the month. Accompanied by Native Officer Tuanku Suror, the District Officer, Miri. left for Niah ou Novem¬ ber 8th to settle an Iban dispute between Peng- hulus Manggoi and Barat regarding a case of Pemali. A satisfactory conclusion was reached and they returned to Miri on the 10th. Padi reports from Sibuti district are satisfactory, despite constant inroads made by pig. Mr. B. A. Trechman, Divisional Treasurer, returned from Kuching on November 5th, and resumed duty in Miri the following day. He was accompanied by Mrs. Trechman and Mrs. Pitt-Hardacre. The District Officer, Bintulu, reports that dining November work proceeded satisfactorily on the drainage system of the Bintulu Landing Ground. On November 28th a report was received tlhat a Malay named Wan Lee had been taken by a cro¬ codile while bathing oil rumah Leng, S. Jelalong. Apparently Wan Lee was a Belagu Malay who bad walked overland from Belaga to visit relations living in this river. The crocodile has not yet been caught. Seven hundred and sixty-eight vaccinations and thirteen N.A.B. injections were administered in the Baram district during the month. The District Officer, Baram. reports that Peng- hulu Abau Wan was told that as a result of his continual disregard of Penan trading regulations, His Highness the Rajah bad decided to cancel his appointment as from December 31st. Several birds’-nests caves in the vicinity of Long Damn were rifled and stripped of nests. The culprits have not yet been apprehended. Galan, Native Officer, and the Dresser-in-Charge, Baram, proceeded up river on the 22nd to vaccinate everyone living between Marudi and Long Laput. The only districts now remaining to be done are the headwaters of Baram and the Bakong. Owing to the bad harvest a number of headmen have asked for assistance in feeding their people, and rice has been issued to those in urgent need. The want at the moment is not as acute as is anticipated in a month or so, just before the present crop ripens. Rainfall was very heavy at Baram during the whole of November, and the river, as a result, has been in continual flood. Those persons who have not learnt their lesson from the floods of last year, and have again planted on the banks of the rivers, have been very perturbed to sec their fields flooded. So far, the crop is not old enough and the floods of insufficient duration to have done much harm. The majority of the young rice is of good quality but is already suffering from the ravages of rats and mice. The work on the bazaar road at Baram has again been hampered by floods. The original layer put down by the contractor was entirely washed away, and he had to start afresh. The old Baram Astana has been demolished at very small cost, and much of the timber was found to be in sufficiently good condition to be used again, Even the posts, although rotten near and below the ground, will be of use for parts of the new building. Four telephone linesmen arrived at Baram from Kuching on the 12th to supervise and assist in the r-wiring of all lines in the station, including that to Bakong. Every post is also being replaced, and the new timber has been supplied from up river at a very reasonable cost. The linesmen have been hindered by high water, but have made good pro¬ gress and have finished the station and half the Bakong line. The plan for the new Chinese school at Baram has becn passed by the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, and the principals have given instructions for the collection of timber. They hope to start building early in the new year. The Rev. Father Feltbrugge visited the Baram district from the 9th to the 25th. During his stay he visited Lubok Nibong, and walked from Long Lupan, the Uma Bawang house, across country to the Tru. On the 15th Mr. L. O. Bruce, the Acting Resident, arrived at Baram with a party from M.Y. Rosaura The party included Lord Moyne, Vis¬ count Elveden. Lady Broughton and Miss Brough¬ ton, the Hon. A. F. C. H. Chaplin and Mrs. Chaplin. Mr. Bruce remained in Marudi and the others were taken up to see the Kayan house at Long Laput, wherc they spent the night, return¬ ing to Miri the next day. The conveyances used were two high-powered speed-boats from the yacht. Unfortunately, they travelled one immediately behind the other, and the double wash caused con¬ siderable damage, completely sinking two boats, and demolishing many floating wharves. Com¬ pensation has been applied for, and in the case of the boats sunk, has already been paid. A meeting was held on the 21st between the shop-keepers of the Marudi and Lubok Nibong bazaars to investigate and discover the actual reasons for the petitions put before His Highness the Rajah. The former bazaar wishes the latter to be abolished, claiming that it is a "pirate" and diverting most of the trade to itself. The Resident of the meeting has been forwarded to the Resident for his consideration. The health of the Limbang district has been good, and no epidemics occurred. All passengers arriving from Kuching were examined for diph¬ theria. The District Officer, Limbang and Lawas, reports that Peughulu Wee and a number of Dayaks came down during the month, bringing rattans, padi and jungle produce for the market. Penghulu Wee had just completed rounds of his district ami a number of cases were settled. Most of the up-river people at Limbang have finished their jagong crop, which seems unusually early, and padi looks promising everywhere. The tapping holiday which finished on the 18th was again successful, and at Limbang no one was found tapping during the prescribed period. The Panderuan road had to be closed to motor traffic most of the month owing to the amount of rain and the bad condition of the road. Messrs. Aikman and Sergei. Rubber Census Officers, arrived at Lawas by H.H.M.Y. Maimuna complete with staff on November 23rd. They left Lawas on the 25th and after a short visit to Sundar arrived Trusan the same evening. Mr. & Mrs. Southwell and Mr. Young of the Borneo Evangelical Mission sailed for Australia on leave during the month. The Lawas (Sarawak) Estates, Ltd., exported 15,680 lbs. of dry rubber during the month. CORRESPONDENCE. [The Editor is not responsible for the opinions of correspondents.] Is “Gendang Tanda” an Entertainment ? Upper SARAWAK, 15th December, 1935. The Editor, The , Kuching. SIR, I laving read with interest the article under the above heading, which appeared in your December issue, I beg to appreciate the writer for taking the privilege of expressing his opinion of the local Malay dance. Your correspondent’s opinion is, however, very similar to those of our former writers, whose articles appeared in this Gazette, and in the vernacular newspapers of Malaya some years ago. This means that Mohamed Nor-Hel is not the only man who would sacrifice himself in writing about the subject. There is also a Malay novel by name Melati Sarawak, edited and published by one of my best friends. The author’s aim is no other than that of other writers; he calls the play Suara kulit kambing kring. Besides describing about the beauty and modesty of the performance, Mohamed Nor-Hel at the same time makes a criticism over the doers. It is a nuisance to the Kampong dwellers, he said, because people cannot get enough sleep at night. There¬ fore he advises the headmen of the Kampongs and the well-to-do people to restrict the. time of the main. He points out to his readers that the objectors of the gendang tanda arc the “Ulama," "Kadi," and "Lebai." Now, Sir. it is my turn to express my opinion, Gendang tanda is undeniably an entertainment. It is a Folk dance in which its national charac¬ teristics are strongly discernable; and the only [jerformance that the local bujangs every time expect to enjoy. In accordance with bis enthusiastic Malay article, which appeared on page 226, in the same issue of the Gazette, Mohamed Nor-Hei means that gendang tanda an evil performance, that is, it leads young folks to immoral behaviour. Do you think so, my readers? Finally, Sir. the only way to moralise the young folks is to give the girls proper education, by establishing vernacular schools in the villages. The problem of the expenditure for the establishments is in my readers' own knowledge. Yours faithfully, MOHAMMED JOE. THE . PRICE KUCHING, Monday, March 2nd, 1936. 20 CENTS. The . MONDAY- MARCH 2nd. 1936. 1935. The general recovery which we were able to record in our survey of 1934 was maintained almost without interruption during the past year. 1935, though not in any way a spectacular year, was yet one of prosperity and steady progress; the benefits of the trade improvement that was so marked in 1934 were felt everywhere, and the gains which this improvement made possible in so many different fields were consolidated. The financial position of the State was further strengthened during the year, the revenue exceeding the expenditure by approximately $875,000 as compared with $991,764 in 1934. It is worth (pointing out. however, that the difference between these two figures is significant in that it shows that when we speak of ‘recovery’ we do not mean that there has been any general return to pre-depression conditions. Far from it. A certain measure of settled prosperity has returned to the State, but that is all. Although we can now face the future with confidence, there is no present justification for any reversion to the blind optimism of the 1920's. Caution and foresight are still just as necessary as they were three years ago; it should be home in mind that the trade revival throughout the Far East is to a great extent due to rubber restriction, and although at the moment this measure appears to be achieving its objects, its success is not vet assured. Sarawak’s traditional policy of building up reserves during good years enabled the country to come through the depression successfully, and we are glad to see that this wise financial policy is again to bo followed. As soon as revenue shows a substantial surplus over expenditure there is always a temptation to embark on ill-considered schemes of ‘development,’ but fortunately the lessons of the slump have been taken to heart. and though development will, of course, proceed, it will do so on rational lines and will not be unduly accelerated at the expense of the financial stability of the country. Mention of development brings us to one of the notable events of the year, namely, the compilation of what is now known as the "Blue Reports" Towards the end of 1934 Divisional Residents were informed that a survey of the working of the administration during the past few years had caused His Highness the Rajah to direct that an inquiry should be held on the results achieved, and that a report should be furnished on which His Highness could he guided in laying down a definite policy for the future development of the State. The preparation of this report was entrusted to an experienced officer of the Civil Service, who was relieved of his ordinary duties for this purpose, and who was therefore able, to devote his whole time to the necessary inquiry, in the course of which almost every station in the country was visited. This officer's terms of reference Were extremely wide; lie was authorized to, and did. obtain the views of representatives of all sections of the community. The results were co-ordinated into an exhaustive report which is now in the hands of the Committee of Administration. Certain recommendations in this report have already been put into effect, and is understood that His Highness the Rajah intends shortly to appoint a commission to consider the remaining proposals, and to resolve them into a comprehensive scheme of development to cover the next ten years. The trade figures, which are at present only available for the first eleven months of the year, reveal a satisfactory position, though they show also that the steep upward trend that was a feature of 1934 has not been repeated during 1935. Trade has now found its level after the violent fluctuations caused first by the boom, and then by the depression, and has settled down to what we hope may be regarded as its normal condition. Rubber, which is our most important agricultural product, maintained a satisfactory price level during the year, the average Singapore quotation being $26.83 per picul. This comparatively high figure is, of course. directly attributable to the effect of restriction, which, although it has admittedly brought increased wealth to rubber producers in the State, has also resulted in unbalanced commodity values. This naturally makes for difficulties in any scheme of regulation not based on individual control. In addition to the natural restriction imposed by rigid control and limitation of immigration, and the normal reduced output self-imposed by smallholders by reason of their mixed occupations, and the lack of additional labour, it was found necessary to declare two tapping holidays. This gave rise, not unnaturally, to a good deal of dissatisfaction, and caused difficulties which varied according to the type and size of holdings. The first holiday appeared to be fully successful; the second was not so convincing, and it is now apparent that restriction will continue to produce serious problems which were not envisaged when the measure was first introduced.—problems, moreover, which arc enchanced by the fact that estate rubber forms but a very small pereentage of the total production, and that control is thereby rendered extremely difficult. It may be mentioned, in passing, that the control of immigration, although essential in the interests of restriction, cannot hut have an adverse effect on other industries, and therefore on the general prosperity of the State, by causing a shortage of labour just when it is most needed. This, though only one of the many difficulties encountered, will serve to show that regulation is not an unmixed blessing as far as Sarawak is concerned. Early in the year it was decided to undertake a census of rubber holdings throughout the State, and an Administrative officer and an officer of the Department of Lands and Surveys were seconded for this purpose, together with a special staff. Statistics obtained from the census are not yet complete, and it is therefore not yet possible to make an accurate estimate of the potential production of the State, but there can now be little doubt that it is considerably in excess of the quota allotted under the International Agreement, Rubber exports for the first eleven months of 1935 totalled 311.753 piculs valued at $7,162,804 as against 278,301 piculs valued at $6,583,509 for the same period of 1934, At the end of this article there will be found a table giving the comparative export figures for the more important products of the State for 1935 and 1934. Increases will be noted in rubber, sago-flour and damar, and, of course, in illipe nuts, of which there was no crop during the previous year. Decreases are found in pepper, gold, jelutong and rattans; the heavy drop in pepper exports was chiefly due to the serious slump in price during the latter part of the year, probably aided by the continued enhanced price of rubber. The illipe nut crop did not come up to expectations, although it is likely that a good deal remained uncollected and unexported, again probably due to the counterattraction of rubber. The first half of the year showed a considerable increase in imports compared with 1934, but it will probably be found that this increase was not maintained during the second half of the year; this falling-off will most likely be mainly attributable to the heavy slump in pepper. As a result of the continued high price of gold, this metal was profitably worked in Upper Sarawak, where about twenty-one mining companies were operating at the end of the year. Although gold exports showed a slight decrease on the 1934 figure, the production of one or two individual companies was unprecedentedly high, one syndicate obtaining no less than 1,017 fine ozs. during August. All hough it is anticipated that any serious drop in the price of gold would cause most of the mines in Upper Sarawak to close down, there are indications that gold-bearing areas are not confined to this district alone, and there is a possibility of extensive prospecting operations in the First Division in the near future. Considerable interest has also been shown in antimony. During the year excellent progress was made in the timber export trade. There are still obstacles to be overcome, but it is gratifying to note that three mills now export regularly to England, while another mill will enter the trade as soon as its equipment is complete. Exports to all parts in 1934 were just over 109,000 cubic feet; the 1935 figures are not yet ready, but by the end of the third quarter exports had exceeded 194.000 cubic feet. Exports to the United Kingdom for the whole year exceeded 45,000 cubic feet as compared with approximately 20,000 cubic feet in 1931. While on the subject of timber, the progress made with the protected forest scheme is worth noting. This scheme, which was introduced in 1934, seems to have eliminated the opposition with which the reservation of forests was so often met in the past, while yet giving adequate protection to timber. Dining the eighteen months of its operation 255.000 acres have been preliminarily proclaimed, while during 1935 181,000 acres were constituted protected forests, thus increasing the area dedicated to forestry in the State by about 50%. To turn to administrative matters, the country as a whole was peaceful throughout the year. A few Dayak outlaws remained at large in the Second and Third Divisions, but did not no active harm, since they have now become fugitives and remain in hiding in the more inaccessible parts of the interior. Their apprehension is therefore rendered exceedingly difficult, but the system of regular Government patrols in suspected areas, coupled with the maintenance of garrisoned blockhouses in the head-waters of certain rivers, effectually prevents them from coming into the open and doing any damage, and makes their eventual capture or destruction inevitable. One case of head-hunting occurred during the year, a Chinese pepper planter, his wife, and two children being murdered near Song by two Dayaks, who were caught shortly afterwards in the Second Division many miles from the scene of their crime. At their trial the two men pleaded guilty, and it appeared that this appalling outrage was a case of head-hunting pure and simple. The two men were duly sentenced to death and executed, and there is no doubt that their prompt arrest, conviction and execution has had a most salutary effect on the younger Dayaks. It is hoped that a lesson has been administered that will not soon be forgotten. During the year there was no disturbance or political tiniest anywhere, all races remaining peaceful and contented. There was, indeed, a marked increase in the general prosperity of tin native population, and the hardship which could be observed in the kampongs during the depression may now he regarded as a tiling of the past. Apart from rubber, there was an increase in the demand for certain commodities worked or produced by natives, and although this increased demand was only seasonal —as in the case of the. minor boom in damar which occurred at Bintulu—it was none the less welcome. Settlement of rights to land was completed in the Oya and Dalat district, and by the end of the year was well under way at Mukah. and had been commenced at Sarikei. At the end of the year settlement was also nearly complete, in the Balingian district. As a result of the rubber census, which woke up a large number of squatters, there was a rush of applications for titles for land already planted with rubber; the slump in pepper, however, resulted in a heavy decrease in applications for peppnr land. A census of the Simanggang Road area was carried out in December, and produced interesting results, since it was found that during the short time since the road was opened nearly three thousand people had settled in the one mile reserve between the 10th mile and Serian, and that in the same reserve 7,300 acres had not merely been alienated, hut were actually under cultivation. Legislation enacted during the year included the Labour Protection Order, which consolidates all existing Orders and Regulations on the subject of labour, and which was prepared as a result of several years’ experience of the working of the old Order, which had been based on the Straits Settlements Ordinance; other important Orders were the Agricultural Pests Order, the Air Navigation Order, and the Carriage by Air Order. Air Commodore S. W. Smith, Air Officer Commanding the Royal Air Force, Far East, paid the first of several visits to Kuching on January 14th. Colonel J. F. Turner, Director of Works and Buildings in the Air Ministry, arrived at Pending by flying-boat on March 10th. It bad already been decided to construct landing-grounds at Kuching, Bintulu and Miri, and the sites for these landinggrounds were inspected and approved by Colonel Turner during his visit. Satisfactory progress on the landing-grounds at Kuching and Bintulu could be recorded by the end of the year. His Excellency Admiral Sir Frederic Dreyer, Naval Commander-in-Chief of the China Station, visited Kuching in H.M.S. Falmoutk on February 4th. Other warships which visited the State were H.M.S. Bridgewater, which arrived at Kuching on January 8th, and H.M.S. Herald which called at Pending on August 30th on her way to Rejang, where she carried out a hydrographic survey of the approaches to the Rejang River. She returned to Hong Kong on November 20th. His Excellency the British Agent for Sarawak, accompanied by Lady Thomas and Miss Thomas, paid a short visit to Kuching on August 8th, leaving for Miri the same night. During the year we were able to welcome the Earl and Countess of Inchcape, who arrived at Kuching on February 19th and stayed for some weeks. This was Lord Inchcape’s first visit to Sarawak. His Highness the Rajah left for England on May 8th, and returned on August 4th, accompanied by Dayang Valerie. Her Highness the Ranee arrived in Kuching on February 21th. His Highness the Tuan Muda arrived in Kuching on June 21th, having travelled from Amsterdam to Singapore by sir, and left the State by flying-boat on February 27th. Between the departure of His Highness the Rajah and the arrival of His Highness the Tuan Muda, the State was administered by the Committee of Administration. Local and Personal, FEBRUARY. When Her Highness the Ranee arrived at Croydon on January 17th, there was snow on the ground,—rather a contrast to Singapore, which Her Highness had left a week previously! Mr. A. W. D. Brooke has been appointed Assistant Collector of Land Revenue. Besut, Trengganu. We welcome back to Kuching the Right Rev. the Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak, who returned from furlough on February 24th. The Bishop was accompanied by the Rev. Father E. K. Talbot, C.R., M.C., Chaplain to the King. Father Talbot is superior of the Community of the Resurrection, having succeeded Bishop Frere in that position on the latter’s appointment to the Bishopric of Truro. We understand that he intends to remain in Sarawak until May. and that during his stay he will take the opportunity of visiting local mission outstations. Mr. R. F. W. Leonard of the Straits Steamship Co., Singapore, paid a short visit to Kuching during the month. Mr. D. V. Murphy, Assist ant Commissioner, Sarawak Constabulary. returned from furlough by the Marudu on February 3rd. Mr. Murphy has gone temporarily to Mill to relieve Mr. Sochon. who has been transferred to the Third Division. Mr. G. T. Bates, Manager of Messrs, the Borneo Co., Ltd., arrived from furlough by the same boat. We understand that Mr. P. Cobbold, who has been acting for Mr. Bates during his absence, will shortly go to Sibu. Mr. K. H. Digby, passed cadet, has been transferred to Simanggang. Mr. Digby relieved Mr. Griffin, who has been appointed to do duty in Kuching. The stamps of Sarawak have been rather to the fore lately, since they have been dealt with at length by "L. B. R." in two successive issues of the Stamp Lover, the cover of the November number bearing a reproduction of Sir Francis Grant's celebrated portrait of the first Rajah. In the December number a full history of the development of the postal services of Sarawak is given, together with photographs of various post-offices and stamp issues, and a list of successive holders of the office of Postmaster-General. In Sarawak and Her stamps, by Messrs. G. E. Hansford and N. A. Noble, (the Times Press, Ryde, I.W.) the authors have made a most exhaustive study of the philatelic history of Sarawak, and of the position to-day. This book can be confidently recommended not only to philatelists, but also to anyone interested in Sarawak history. The accuracy of the information it contains is a tribute both to the authors’ enthusiasm and powers of research, and the subject-matter is of more than purely specialised interest. The authors have presented a copy of their book to His Highness the Rajah, and we understand that at the request of the Private Secretary to His late Majesty King George V, who was a noted philatelist, a copy was sent to Buckingham Palace. His many friends will be interested to learn that P. Ratnavelu Odayar, an old pupil of the local St. Joseph’s Institution, and son of Mr. V. Pakiry Odayar, formerly of the Public Works Department, Kuching, who had been qualifying himself in India for Agriculture and other alied subjects, has recently lieen selected out of about a hundred applicants and appointed as a Farm Manager in an estate in South India. Mr. H. P. K. Jacks, who arrived in Kuching on February 3rd, has been appointed a cadet in the Civil Service. Mr. Jacks is at present doing duty at Bau. We print elsewhere in this issue an article on “Shorts for Women” taken from the Straits Times. This article is so very much to the point that we reproduce it in full, and we hope that it will be taken to heart- by our lady readers. Captain A. C. Benfield who returned to Kuching from furlough on February 10th. is now again in command of s.s. Vyner Brooke. Captain Borton has gone on home leave. King’s Message to the Empire. From the British Official Press—1st March, 1936. The King's broadcast speech to the Empire was delivered this afternoon in the following terms :— "It has been an ancient tradition of the British Monarchy that a new Sovereign should send a written message to his peoples. Science has made it possible for me to make that written message more personal and to speak to you all over the radio. This, however, is no innovation, for my father has for the last few years spoken to his peoples at Christmas time. Little more than two mouths ago he broadcast his last Christmas message, and to many of you the sound of his voice must still seem to be ringing in your ears. He was speaking then at the close of a long and wonderful reign which covered a period of twenty-five years, during which unprecedented changes have taken place and great anxieties and problems have been shared by all. Throughout his reign he set a high example of constant devotion to duty and he was ever concerned for the welfare of his subjects and of all those under his protection. In times of adversity his calm confidence was an inspiration to all his people and he shared in their joys as well as in their sorrows. I know how in the Dominions, in India, in the Colonics and Dependencies the bond of loyalty to the Crown—that symbol of unity of many lands and populations—has been strengthened by a tie of personal devotion to my father. I feel that his death is not only an overwhelming grief to my mother and to us, his children, but that it is at the same time also a personal loss to you all. To the Princes and peoples of India I send my greeting as King-Emperor. Manifestations of your sorrow and of your loyalty at this time have been a source of deep gratification to me. Associations in peace and hi war between the British and Indian peoples have been long and honourable and the example set by Queen Victoria, King Edward the Seventh and King George the Fifth lays on me as their successor a solemn trust to maintain and strengthen these associations. Queen Mary, my family and myself have been greatly helped by world-wide tributes of genuine sorrow which we have received from every side. Vast crowds assembled reverently at the funeral homage to the late King's memory, and written words of sympathy by thousands of people, not only those resident within the British Empire but in many foreign countries as well, is a thing that we will never forget. It is wonderful for us to know how universally my father's great qualities have been appreciated and valued. It is no mere form of speech to say that he reigned in the hearts of his people. Aud it was his happiness to know before he died that his long years of unstinted service were rewarded by a devotion and an affection so perfectly expressed in the Jubilee demonstrations of last year. It falls upon me to succeed him and to carry on his work. I am better known to most of yon as the Prince of Wales, as the man who during the war and since has had the opportunity of getting to know people of nearly every country of the world under all conditions and circumstances. And although I now speak to you as the King, I am still that same man who has that experience, and whose constant effort it will be to continue to promote the well-being of his fellow men. May the future bring peace and understanding throughout the world, prosperity and happiness to the British people, ami may we be worthy of the heritage which is ours." Message of Sympathy from Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee to Her Majesty the Queen. The following letter was addressed by Her Highness the Ranee to Her Majesty the Queen on January 27th :— MADAM, 1 have only just returned from Sarawak by air, and the Rajah has cabled me asking me to express our deep sympathy. Thanks to the wonderful medium of the films, our people in Sarawak have been able to learn what the devotion of a whole nation to the most beloved Sovereign who has ever reigned means. May I express to Your Majesty from myself and die Rajah, our Government officers, and the people of Sarawak, sincere sympathy with Your Majesty in your great loss. I remain, Your Majesty's humble and loyal tenant, SYLVIA OF SARAWAK. On January 30th, Her Highness the Ranee received the. following letter from the Countess of Minto. The Countess of Minto is a Lady-in- Waiting, and is one of the oldest friends of Her Majesty the Queen. BUCKINGHAM PALACE. DEAR RANEE, I am commanded by the Queen to thank you for your very kind message of sympathy which Her Majesty greatly appreciates. Please convey to the Rajah, and also to your Government and the people of every class. Her Majesty's thanks for the expression of sorrow on the death of our beloved King. The Queen is glad that the films have enabled the people of Sarawak to follow the last sad ceremonies that have taken place. The devoted messages of loyal sympathy very greatly touch the Queen. Yours sincerely, MARY MINTO. Sarawak Museum. CURATOR'S ANNUAL REPORT. We print below extracts from the 1935 report on the Sarawak Museum, prepared by Mr. E. Banks, the Curator :— EXPEDITIONS. In January, and again in December, I visited Tanjong Sirik and other parts of the Rejang ‘‘delta,” the best place for collecting migrant birds which are sometimes on misty nights attracted to the lighthouse very much as at some better-known European resorts. From the map this area appears to be the delta of the large Rejang River, but the presence on these islands of the same three species of squirrels as on the mainland suggests the river may have carved its present outlets through what was at one time part of the mainland. In July I spent a fortnight on top of Mulu, an account of which occurs in the Sarawak Museum Journal. In September a quick trip was made to Penrissen, a mountain in the head-waters of the Sarawak River, where it was once supposed a health resort could be made, the prospect being reviewed by the late Mr. J. C. Moulton in the for 1910. The top, some 4,401) feet high, was clothed in large trees and dense jungle, the ground sloping gently with occasional shallow gullies holding water, the whole plateau some half a mile long and not more than two hundred yards broad ns I paced it. This gives an area from 30 to 40 acres and a few hundred feet lower is a smaller plateau, between 2,000 and 3,000 feet another plateau again about the same area as the top one. Penrissen is therefore a series of flat steps up to 30 or 40 acres in extent and offers no one considerable area for development. ZOOLOGY. A bull and a cow "Tembadau" (Bos Banteng), the Bornean Wild Ox, shot by the Curator near Belaga in 1927, were very kindly mounted for us by the Rafiles Museum. They are the largest acquisition we have had for many years, and of the more interest as there are few mounted examples in other Museums. Tn good times the purchase of coloured plaster easts of whales will be worth considering; we have a skeleton of the Killer Whale (Orca gladiator) and the Rhorqual Whale (Balaenoptera Schlegeli) from 20-25 feet long, coloured plaster easts of which would cost from £50 to £60, half of which is payable by an exchange of specimens. The sale of wild animals is everywhere becoming increasingly restricted save when destined to wellknown Zoological Gardens or Institutions, and there is some evidence we are perhaps being too “easy” in exporting live animals. There is an increasing demand for live Wawas (Gibbons) which could once he purchased from $1 to $5 each in Kuching, and now cost anything from $15 to $25. which indicates Sarawak is one of the last unstopped sources of supply for these animals. I have to recommend the export fee be raised from $1 to $5 each for Wawas to prevent the idle trade in them, but to leave accredited institutions the opportunity to purchase them if desired. A few Fire Back Pheasants worth a dollar or two each are exported every year, but there have been some attempts in outstations to export Bulwer's pheasants, worth from $40 to $80 each, on permits lor Fire Baek pheasants, and efforts to prevent this have not always been successful. Birds. The British Museum very generously divided up the Sarawak birds collected by the Oxford expedition to Dulit in 1932, and the following good things were added to our collection : Caleoperdix oculea borneensis, a mountain partridge new to our collection; Cyanoptila bella and Stoparola thalassina, unusual migrants; Herizillas magnirostrix, Stachyris poliocephala, and the two spider hunters. Arachnothera juliae and everetti. This year's collecting produced Sterna hirundo longipennis, the Eastern common tern; Ardea einere.a rectiroslris the Eastern grey heron, and Helodramas ochropus, the green sandpiper, all three new to Borneo; Perzana pusilla, a small rail, Spitornis cheela kinabaluensis, a mountain eagle, Cyomis unicolor infuscata, a blue flycatcher, Scicerreus t. trivirgata, and Cettia montana. two little mountain birds from Mulu, were all new to our collections and also to Sarawak, with two exceptions. Other rare additions were Arborophila brunneopectus hyperythra. a tree partridge. Atheonoptera spilocephalus luciae, Dcndrobiastes hyperylhra malayana, Rhinomyias gularis, Stoparola cerviniventris, Lanioturdinus crassus, Brachypteryx erythrogyna, Grneirhla everetti, Pachyeephala hypoxantha and Chlorocharis eniiliac mouKoni, all from Mulu. Acrocephalus orientalis and Locustella certhiola were two unusual reed warblers from Sirik. 1935 proved an exceptionally good collecting year —besides fourteen hundred unusual species, five others new to the collection and three others new to Borneo wore taken. Last year three species new to the collection and one new to Borneo were taken, so that Sarawak is not yet exhausted as a collecting ground. Interest is still maintained in the edible bird'snest industry, and in Baram the close-season and auction of nests enforced by successive administrative officers has resulted both in an increase in the number of nests and a rise in the price obtained. REPTILES. I am indebted to the Secretary for Native Affairs (Mr. F. H. Pollard) and the Datus concerned for access to the daily records of the number of turtle laid for several vears on the. islands of Satang, Tolling Besar and Kechil; the annual laying is subject to great fluctuations, and is worth further investigation. It is hoped soon to move the spirit collections of reptiles, amphibia and fishes at present lodged in inaccessible galleries above the Museum’s top floor to the store room at present occupied by the herbarium. and by collections of mammals' and birds’ skins which will move to the new building. BOTANY. The Natural History Order, which prohibited the collecting of orchids without a permit, has been amended, and they may now be collected by anyone, but in no circumstances may they be afterwards exported. Collections of Ebenaceae, Datiscaceae, Pedaliaeeae and Planiaginaceae were sent to Buitenzorg and a large collection of Myrtaceae was returned named from New York by Dr. E. D. Merrill. A named collection of such insect pests commonly known to attack Sarawak crops was presented to the Agricultural Department. The Senior Agricultural Officer presented a largo quantity of fossil-like objects found in the 12th mile Experimental Gardens. They take the form of long narrow tubes, often with bulb like expansions, the narrow passages extending some distance in the hard matrix, occasionally with animal-like impressions, and similar objects have been obtained at Engkilili and Baram. Mr. Tweedie of Raffles Museum informs me they are of concretionary origin, and not fossils at all. ETHNOLOGY. Some redundant exhibits were stored and the rest re-arranged, but there is still too little space to show them to advantage. Eight flat-topped cases were tilted at a convenient angle, their black reflecting background being replaced by white paper on which it is proposed to stencil English and possibly Jawi labels. The removal of the office and reference library to the new building leaves empty a lower wing of the Museum; this I propose to fill with the insert and other zoological collections from above, reducing all the natural history collection to the ground floor and leaving space above for expansion of the ethnological galleries. We now have over 2,500 exhibits, and anything really new is unusual. Some highly prized Kayan beads from the Rejang River are therefore of interest, especially as their genuineness was attested by tbe people of the Baram River, who gave them the same names and much the same value ns their original owners. They are not striking or beautiful : two Bua Wang Batang Uma are cylindrical beads about half an inch long, and valued at about $15 each, the one dark green with reddish markings, each with a yellowish ring, the other dark bine with pale bluish rings round reddish blotches. Bua Wang Noring and Kalamahit Keding are small spherical beads worth $7 each, both with a black background and very appropriate red and yellow patterns, the former with narrow zigzag markings, the latter with broad diagonal streaks. LIBRARY. The Sarawak Library, which was formerly housed in a small, old. and no longer water-tight building, was removed in December to new premises capable of holding twice as ninny volumes. Visit to Kuching of No. 205 (Flying Boat) Squadron. OFFICIAL RECEPTION FOR AIR COMMODORE S. W. SMITH. The three Royal Air Force flying-boats comprising No. 205 squadron arrived’ at Fending at 11.40 a.m. on February 10th. They were met by H.H.M.Y. Maimuna, which conveyed the officers of the squadron to Kuching. As the Maimuna passed fort Margherita a salute of eleven guns was fired from the fort battery. The Maimuna anchored off Astana and was boarded by the Treasurer, acting for the Government Secretary, who was off duty through illness, and the Resident, First Division. The R.A.F. officers then landed at Astana steps; the Air Commodore inspected a Constabulary guard of honour, which was drawn up on the Astana lawn, and was then met at the Astana porch by His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie. Members of the Council. Negri and certain other officers were waiting on the Astana verandah. Refreshments were handed round, and His Highness the Rajah welcomed the squadron to Kuching, and proposed the success of the Far Eastern flight, wishing the Air Commodore and his officers all good fortune on their cruise, and a safe return. This toast was drunk by all prosent, and the Air Commodore replied in a short speech of thanks. The gathering then dispersed. During the afternoon Mr. and Mrs. R. L. Daubeny were at home’ at the Residency to a large number of guests, and in the evening His Highness the Rajah gave a dinner at Astana in honour of the squadron's visit. About thirty guests were present. This was followed by a dance at the Sarawak Club. The N.C.O.’s and men were given free seats at the first performance at Sylvia Cinema, by courtesy of His Highness the Rajah, and were later entertained to a dinner at the Government Rest House, Mr. A. G. Taylor and a few other gentlemen acting as hosts. During dinner a programme of music was rendered by the Kuching Military baud. The flying-boats .were due to leave at 7 o'clock on the morning of February 11th, but a few hours earlier a violent storm broke and continued without intermission until nearly 10 a.m., rendering their departure impossible. They therefore took off early on the morning of February 12th, although even then weather conditions were by no means favourable, visibility being poor. with rain and mist and some intermittent thunder. The squadron reached Kudat in safety the same afternoon, however, and went on to Manila the following day. After leaving Tending, Air Commodore Smith addressed the following telegram to the Aide-de- Camp to His Highness the Rajah :— "Will you please convey to His Highness grateful thanks of myself Wing Commander Scott mid all ranks for your hospitality and help the honour received on arrival was much appreciated and I particularly commend the smartness of the guard of honour." His Highness replied as follows:— Your message much appreciated. Please convey to all ranks mv best wishes for a successful flight?' The squadron was commanded by Wing Commander C. I.. Scott ; apart from the Air Commodore, the remaining officers were Squadron Leader K. B. Lloyd; Squadron Leader G. C. Bladon; Flight- Lieut. G. S. Riccard; Flying-Officer A. G. F. Stewart, and Flying-Officer M. D. Thunder. Singapore Revisited. SOME IMPRESSIONS. lu this part of the world one hears a good deal, one way and another, about Singapore Ear and Singapore Foot, but not very much about Singapore Face, although this is an ailment that is at least as prevalent as the other two. It manifests itself in a number of different ways, but the main symptom is an expression as though a piece of india-rubber were being burnt directly beneath the affected person's nostrils. ('Affected.' incidentally, seems the right word in this context). In the more advanced stages a marked hauteur spreads itself gradually over the sufferer's features until in the end his face becomes a blank mask of arrogance and self-complacency. As I have already indicated, the prognosis of this disease is grave, and there is no real cure except an immediate return to Europe, where the restoration of a sens? of proportion usually has a noticeably beneficial effect. Unexpected retrenchment, too, has been known to work wonders. The incidence of this disease among the European population of Singapore is causing the Public Health authorities serious concern. There was a time, during the worst phase of the depression, when Singapore Eace disappeared almost entirely, but since it seems to thrive on prosperity, it has been steadily on the increase during the past two years, and is now more widespread than ever. If you doubt this, then go and stand in Victoria Square between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, and watch the cars roll by. In each luxurious limousine—and it is of there that the procession largely consists,—there reclines a ‘Tuan Besar,’ (Anglicé, Big Noise,) and you will at once perceive that he has readied an acute stage of the disorder. Bad cases are also to be seen at the Swimming Club, where it will be noticed that women are just as liable to this affliction as men; indeed, it seems to attack them, if anything, with even greater virulence. And it is a mistake to assume that only those who can boast a large salary and many years' residence in the Colony can be attacked : no one is immune, indeed incipient cases can be detected even among junior mercantile assistants, and cadets in the Malayan Civil Service frequently contract the malady before they even step ashore. At first sight Singapore seems to be full of bareheaded. smooth-jowled young Englishmen in highly chromatic shirts who are in a perpetual state of hurry about some business of the first importance. That, at any rate, is the impression one gels in and around Collyer Quay and Baffles Place on any ordinary week-day morning. One meets these busy young men everywhere. They all look alike.— sleek, well dressed, with clipped moustaches and a sort of quiet truculence in their demeanour that makes one step smartly out of their way. They radiate self-confidence, hustle, and the will-to-geton; so much so, in fact, that they are a trifle overwhelming, just at first, to anyone used to the more leisurely ways of the outposts. What do they do all day, these superb young men? Certainly, they do not seem to spend much time in their offices. Are they employed, perhaps, by the Chamber of Commerce to rush around continually with that intense air in order to give strangers a favourable impression of Singapore's business activity ? This is certainly one explanation of what otherwise appears an insoluble mystery. Singapore is a gracious city. It is a city of open squares, wide streets, well-kept lawns, and really excellent roads; it has good shops, pleasant places of entertainment, and reasonably good hotels, and can boast a number of amenities which prove that the Municipal authorities really do consider the comfort and convenience of the public. It also possesses a fascinating Chinatown which is like an enlargement of the Chinese bazaars in Sarawak, only more so. Singapore lies almost on the Equator, and is separated from England by nearly half the globe; and yet, in spite of ils population of nearly half a million people of all races, colours, and creeds; in spite, too, of the attentions of globetrotting novelists and sensational film-producers, it remains obstinately what it is,—an English Cathedral town. Although it is the meeting place of the whole East ; although ships from most of the maritime countries of the world crowd its harbour; although one reads in the newspapers of Chinese secret societies, and other sinister goings-on; although its shops are (racked with exotic wares, and its streets filled with strange sounds aud sights, and even stranger smells, yet when one. is in Singapore one is conscious, all tire time, of a curiously English atmosphere. Everything is so clean and neat. A large section of the town itself is dominated by a Gothic Cathedral, and the European residential quarter is strongly reminiscent of a garden suburb, —as, indeed, is the outlook of ils inhabitants. And then, the streets arc so well-ordered, the traffic so well-regulated, and the population apparently so peaceful and law-abiding that one thinks instinctively of a prosperous provincial town at home. The machinery of solid British administration is everywhere in evidence. It is so much in evidence, indeed, that it evokes a pleasant sense of security, coupled with a certain smug and rather insular pride. This, we feel, is not an Eastern town. It is a piece of England, established somehow in the tropics; safe, well-ordered, and respectable. For to-day there can be no question about Singapore's respectability. Indeed, it is a trifle too respectable for the returning visitor,—for one, that is, who remembers with a certain pleasant melancholy the festive evenings of nine or ten years ago. The glory is departed, and with it much innocent fun, and also a lot more fun which was not quite so innocent. And yet it had its place in the life of the town, and added undeniably to its character. Singapore may be respectable now, but it is also dull. Although it is still no doubt possible for the initiated to find the kind of thrills that one usually associates with certain quarters of any large Eastern seaport, they are no longer apparent to a casual visitor. Singapore’s respectability is not really surprising, since il is undoubtedly the most thoroughly policed city in the world. In Singapore, you meet a policeman every twenty yards. Every forty yards, you meet two policemen, and at the corner of each important street you will find a police station,—or so it seems. The lot of a Singapore policeman is by no means an unhappy one. His work cannot be very arduous, since so many of his colleagues are busy helping him to do it, and he lives in barracks which one mistakes at first sight for vast blocks of the most modern luxury flats. He is indeed a fortunate creature, and one wonders what he would say if he were suddenly to find himself on patrol in a Sarawak ulu. Never speak Malay in Singapore. For one thing, the chances are that you will not be understood ; for another, if you are. understood, you will at once be rumbled as a country cousin, and will probably be swindled. If, on the other hand, you stick resolutely to English, you may (if you are sufficiently well dressed, or are wearing the wrong kind of topee,) bo mistaken for a tourist; in which case, although you will be swindled just the same, you will at least get Service,—in the expectation of a fat tip. And when in Singapore, never by any chance be polite to Asiatics in subordinate positions. They are there to be shouted at, and don’t you forget it. If you don't shout at them as loud as the other free-born Britons, they will put you down as a freak, and you will be swindled worse than ever. Although English is understood almost everywhere in Singapore, the actual lingua franca is a strange jargon in which the word kasi (pronunced to ryhme with ‘jazzy’) plays rather a disproportionate part. For instance, if a Tuan Besar has agreed to pick up his wife from a friend's house on his way home from the office and drop her at the Swimming Club, he will say to his syce kasi Mem!, and that will be the end of it. It will be noted that although this language can convey a wealth of meaning in a very few words, it is a trifle inadequate as a means of artistic expression. Few great prose works have been written in 'Singaporean,' anil no great poetry. Although there is, of course, that famous quatrain, usually sung to a well-known hymn tune, which begins—Lima ringgit l'ada chukup .... There is another excellent reason for not speaking Malay in Singapore and that is the almost complete absence of Malays. Europeans, Eurasians, Chinese, Tamils, Bengalis, Sikhs,—the streets are thick with them, but the Malay is a rara axis. When you do meet a Malay, he is usually a hired-car driver. And here let me put in a word of praise for that most excellent institution, the Yellow Cab Company. I had better make it clear at once that I have no shares in this or any other company in Singapore, and so have no axe io grind. I am not giving the firm any free publicity,—I am merely putting intending visitors on to a good tiling. These cabs are 8 H.P. Ford Saloons with, as their name implies, a brilliant yellow top. They are almost as cheap as rickshaws, they are clean and comfortable, and they are driven by Malays who are not only courteous and helpful, but who actually know the geography of Singapore! Believe it or not, when you tell them their destination, they will take you there : odd though it may sound, they only have to be told once. And the Company's 'no tip’ rule is scrupulously observed. You will never be asked for a tip. and if. pleased by real courtesy and service, you offer the driver one, it will as often as not be refused. The other hired cars are mostly driven by Indians who are completely ignorant of any language but Hindustani, and whose knowledge of Singapore is such that if you ask them to go to John Tattle’s, they will as likely as not take yon to the Tanglin Club. And if you remonstrate, they at once become threatening,—provided, of course, that one of Singapore’s ubiquitous policemen is not within earshot, in which ease they merely drive you at break-neck speed into the heart of Chinatown, resting one hand lightly on the steering wheel and gaily picking their nose with the other, then stall their engine in the middle of a busy street. Whereupon they immediately demand double their legal fare. How these men obtain their licences is a a mystery. The Malay drivers have an explanation which certainly fits the facts, but since there is a law of libel, I cannot repeat it. Tn most countries a taxi-driver, before he can get a licence, is expected to have some slight knowledge of the geography of the city in which he plies, and nt least a nodding acquaintance with the language spoken in that city. But not in Singapore, apparently. However, let us take a Yellow Cab and drive to the Swimming Club. This is one of the most delightful spots in the whole town. I know of few things more pleasant on a fine morning than to sit at a table by the edge of the swimming pool clad only in a bathing suit, with a tankard of draught beer in front of you. and a pleasant companion by your side. Out to sen, ships come and go: a cool breeze blows, the sea itself laps lazily nt the shore with a most restful sighing, and the clear blue water in the pool invites you to no in just once more before tiffin. It is very pleasant to sit hack, light another cigarette, and think pityingly of your friends working hard in their offices, or else being eaten alive by sand-flies up-river. Here is civilization, peace, and real enjoyment. You have one final splash in the sparkling blue water, finish your beer, change, and drive off for cocktails and luncheon at Baffles Grill. But the Swimming Club is no more. They are pulling it down to make Way for a soulless thing of glass, concrete and steel. The old club with its rambling building, its long chairs, its well-thumbed periodicals, its dingy bar, its cheerful Hylam boys, had atmosphere. It had character. It was really a club, a shabby, comfortable, matey place with no frills. Now, however, a cross, between a sanatorium and a futurist road-house is arising at Katong, —an abortion with no relation to its surroundings, and no air of friendly welcome. One need not be a reactionary to deplore the vulgarisation of what was once such a pleasant institution, and one so typical of Singapore. But at least the swimming pool will remain, and that is something. It must be one of the finest in the world. A stay in Singapore produces a kaleidoscopic pattern of memories. Incidents stand out for a moment defined in the sharpest colours, then merge into a jumble of general impressions. Raffles at night, for instance, its ballroom crowded with smartly-dressed women and their dapper escorts, presents a picture of Western luxury and ease which is in strange contrast to the busy life of the streets on each side of it. And it is in even stranger contrast, perhaps to that other picture, obtained somewhere near Tanjong Pagar, of a down-at-heel European, unshaven and unkempt, voraciously wolfing ten cents’ worth of food at a street hawker's stall. Night falls gently in Singapore, and it is pleasant to drive through the streets in the short tropical dusk. They are filled with people taking the air after the labours of the day, and one is again conscious of the intensely cosmopolitan life around one. The pavements are a medley of palm beach suits, cotton dhotis, white duck, and gaily coloured sarongs, and in the crowd Malay songkok bob up and down beside topees, turbans. felt hats snd bright Javanese head-cloths. Expensive cars roll smoothly by. driven by liveried syces; mosquito buses rattle past, rickshaws thread their way noisily between the traffic, and an occasional bullock-cart jogs slowly homeward, a symbol of the unchanging Rast. As dusk deepens into darkness, neon signs flash into life, giving the town a strangely sophisticated air. The harbour is starred by a thousand twinkling points of light, and along Beach Road the sound of the surf lapping the shore is just perceptible. Yes. this is the best part of the day in Singapore, restful, cool and refreshing. One ends one's drive with a regret that is tempered by the taste of the first stengah of the evening,— always the best of the whole day. With the prospect of an excellent dinner and an amusing party to follow. Singapore seems a better place than ever.—N.E.H.- Women In Shorts. WHAT THE MALAYS SAY—AND IN THE TOWNS—A HORROR IN RAFFLES PLACE. What a lot of trouble the vogue of shorts for women has caused in Malaya! Shorts are far and away the best things to be worn at certain times, but the trouble is that women in this country so often wear them at very much the wrong time. It should be obvious that in an Eastern country, where the sarong and kabaya, the Indian sari, the old-style nonya's costume, and, until recently, voluminous European dresses and petticoats in heavy fabrics, have been the only feminine attire, the wearing of shorts was bound to cause amazement Nevertheless, one does sec flagrant instances of this costume being worn at inappropriate times and places, and this article is intended to suggest when and when not to sport them. "TUB SHAMELESS ONES.” First and foremost, never wear shorts if you are going sightseeing in a Malay district and arc likely to enter a kampong. Women who do this dreadful thing are usually ignorant of the Malay language, and so cannot understand the truly awful things that are said of them as they pass. Shorts on women really do shock these very pleasant country folk, and I have often seen small Malay children' pulled sharply out of the way of the "shameless ones” who come "through our village half-dressed like a man.” If only the European visitors in shorts knew or understood half the utter contempt in the hearts of the quiet, well-behaved people round them, they would rush from the village covered with shame. KAMPONG ETIQUETTE. One must never forget that in Malaya the people of the country have perhaps the best manners in the world, and unless you really know them well, and their outlook, you cannot understand what a quite but overwhelming contempt they have in their hearts for the bad-mannered or vulgar. Surely, therefore, it is wrong to go info their bouses and villages dressed in a way they dislike so much. No doubt ignorance is at the bottom of a great deal of this, but we can all learn, and if we women of an alien race, who until now have been looked up to, wish to keep that position, it would be well for us to ask a few questions from those who know. AN AWFUL SPECTACLE. Next 1 should like to utter a warning against the wearing of shorts whenever they are likely to cause—not disgust, as in the case of the kampong Malays, but ridicule among the more sophisticated people of the towns. Not long ago 1 was waiting outside John Little's for my car to come round, when I happened to see the newspaper sellers and a crowd of boys and men all smiling; 1 also heard the word "Gilah" (mad). When I looked round to see the cause of all this, I was horrified to see a woman of my own nationality, not in her first youth, in a very short pair of bright blue shorts, with a sort of sailor blouse, and a little pair of socks with stripes going round them, coining out of a shop. No wonder the men were laughing—I nearly cried myself. Why in the name of all that is horrible did that woman want to wear shorts to shop in? SYLPHS ONLY. 1 should also like to put in a plea against the wearing of shorts by the over-fat or the over-thin. 1 am certain that though their friends may tell them: "My dear, you look too sweet in them, so original,” if they only heard what those same friends said a few moments later, whilst watching them play, they would turn all colours of the rainbow. . , In a country like this, filled as it is with so many different races, it is certainly up to women of all races not to let their own particular nation down Though it may seem a small matter, if you make yourself a figure of fun you do most certainly harm the prestige of your own race, or, worse still, get all the men in the streets smiling behind their hands. BE CARBFUL! 1 can only ask those of my readers who do care about keeping up the prestige of the country they represent, to think a little more carefully how they wear these useful garments. On the sports field, for tennis, or any outdoor game, nothing could be better, but even there for the Lord's sake have them decently cut. and not bulging all over the wrong places. Please don’t think I have any personal grouse about shorts myself. I haven’t, so long as they hang well, and the right people wear them at the right time. But 1 have been asked by a number of people to put my views—and their views—before the public, and to the best of my ability I have tried to do so.—Straits Budget. “Sold Into Slavery.” THROWN AWAY TO DIE.” FATE OF UNWANTED CHILDREN IN BORNEO. A passage from the last issue of The Borneo Chronicle has been brought to our notice. The Borneo Chronicle is, of course, the official organ of the Borneo Mission Association, which operates in connection with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The passage in question, which appears in the course of a letter to children signed by "Father Wilfrid.’' runs as follows :— "My dear boys and girls, In another pari of this month's Chronicle you will find something about missionary boxes, and on this page you see the new picture of 'Unwanted Children’ which is now on the Borneo missionary boxes. Just imagine how awful it would be if your fathers and mothers id not want you, and so gave you away to anyone who would take you, or sold you to become slaves, or even just threw you away to die as soon as you were born. And yet that is what some of the Chinese do with their unwanted girl babies, and remember that there are a great number of Chinese in Borneo." Shivery, of course, does not exist in Sarawak, and infanticide is almost unknown among the Chinese in Sarawak,—as. indeed, it is among all other races. Moreover, the rights of women and children in Sarawak arc very carefully safeguarded both by law and custom, and their condition generally gives little cause for concern. It therefore seems unfortunate that the official organ of an old-established Mission should publish statements which are, to say the least of it, misleading, and which cannot but tend to create a false impression of conditions in the country in which that Mission operates.

Dickens, as a critic in a weekly review recently remarked, was a literary engine of genius, which, when over-driven, produced from its exhaust large quantities of balderdash. This consists chiefly of appallingly self-conscious purple patches and passages of maudlin sentimentality which, on occasion, can reach truly sublime levels of drivel. The balderdash, though, is most noticeable in his early work, which fortunately does not include David Copperfield, the novel from which Metro- Goldwyn Mayer made the most-boomed picture of 1935. In David Copperfield genius predominates to such an extent that in spite of its faults (and they are many) it remain the finest novel in the English language. Yet all the same, the balderdash is there, subdued, certainly, by Dickens’ more mature artistry, but more the less present. An unimaginative producer with both eyes fixed on the box-office might easily have concentrated on the pinchbeck instead of the gold, and produced a travesty of Dickens' masterpiece, which though artistically a mess, would none the less have had an enormous popular appeal. For unfortunately there can be no mistake about the popular appeal of the worst and most tawdry aspects of Dicken's,—what Maupassant described as cettc sentimentalité béte de I’ouvrier is a force to be reckoned with in the entertainment world. The Directors of the film of David Copperfield, however, have not made this mistake. If unnecessary emphasis seemed at times to be laid on the sentimental passages, it is because these passages are essential to the development of the story. In the book they are so interwoven with the fabric of the plot that they assume their correct perspective, but in a film version they become unduly prominent, and this in turn cannot but react unfavourably on the screen play's artistic proportion. The film of David Copperfield was a brave attempt to perform the impossible. The 600 odd pages of Dickens’ novel (it would be called a 'saga' to-day) just cannot be compressed into two hours on the screen. Although the film was remarkably faithful to the book, it showed us only the hare bones of the story, and by necessarily omitting all Dickens' delicate counterpoint it lost much of the atmosphere that is so truly a feature of the novel. In America, David Copperfield was rated the best film of 1935. This it is not, but it can he placed in the very front rank owing to really firstrate production and acting. And it was truly a miracle of casting. Even- character was right; Micawber. Betsy Trotwood, Peggotty, Uriah Heep and Mr. Murdstone, all the characters with whom we have been familiar since childhood lived again when we saw them on the screen. In a cast which was uniformly excellent it is difficult to single out any individual actor for special praise, but a note must he made of the acting of W. C. Fields. Numerous critics rate this splendid artist as the finest comedian on the screen to-day, and his performance as Micawber confirms their verdict, tubers who were particularly good were Roland Young as Uriah Heep and Lionel Barrymore as Dan Peggotty, and it was a pleasant surprise to find the part of David, the boy, taken by Freddie Bartholomew, and not by some humptions and freckled brat with a biting Chicago twang. It has been announced, incidentally, that a film is to be made of The Tale of Two Cities: this is all to the good, but when will film companies discover Great Expectations ? This is considered by some to be the greatest of all Dickens' novels, and it is certainly one which lends itself particularly well for adaptation to the screen. Several years ago it was discovered that Paul Robeson, besides being an extremely competent actor, had a voice. His deep bass, already familiar to the few from records of Negro spirituals, was made known to the many by the Show Boat. Since then, it has become axiomatic with film producers that Robeson must always bring his music, so to speak, when he arrives on the set. No matter what part he is taking, it is essential for for him to stand up and sing before the last curtain falls. This accounts for the introduction of what was suspiciously like a theme song into Sanders of the River. This song, though pleasant to listen to. rather destroyed the illusion, since from what we hear African chieftains do not, as a rule, sing in metrical and melodious English when proceeding on the war-path. It would have been far more effective to have allowed Paul Robeson to taken an individual part in the savage chanting of the genuine Africans. Sanders of the River, though, was an outstandingly good film, well-acted and well produced. The photography, too, was excellent, some of the river scenes being very impressive. We should have liked to have seen something more of Bones,—‘The Lord Tibbetti' was conspicuous most of the time by his absence, and never approached the gay, maddening, and yet loveable creature so understandingly portrayed by Edgar Wallace. Paul Robeson gave a splendid performance as Bosambo, and Leslie Banks was the exact incarnation of Sanders. Gold Diggers of 1985, featuring Adolphe Menjou. Dick Powell and Alice Brady, was a gay musical show put on with the extreme slickness and efficiency that we have come to expect from productions of this nature. Although it suffered from the typically American fault of exaggeration—one or two of the musical numbers were almost, unbearably prolonged—it was all the same very good entertainment. The prize for the best individual performance of the month goes to Edward G. Robinson for his remarkable, study of Damon Wells in The Man With Two Faces. This was a film which, though not particularly strong in the plot, was rendered genuinely impressive by Robinson's superb acting. He has since earned the unstinted praise of all film critics for his acting in Passport to Fame, in which he stars. No wonder. We can only hope that this picture will soon come to Kuching. Sylvia Cinema. Mainly About Nothing. PSYCHOTHERAPY IN SARAWAK. A writer in a recent issue of Life comments on the startling progress achieved by the science of psychotherapy in the last few years. Nowadays, he says, almost everybody has a phobia or two; certainly, everybody can. All you have to do is to be mortally afraid of something, look it up in an English-Latin dictionary, put it more or less in the ablative case, then tack ‘phobia' on the end. and there you arc. The following are some of the more notable phobias discovered by the All-American Congress of Viennese Brain Watchmen during 1935 : Causutaphobia.—The fear of slight, unimportant occasions. Effossophohia.—The fear of being eaten by crows. Pausayhobia.—The fear, on a train, that the engineer will die. Centimanophobia.—The fear of having a hundred hands. Excoctophobia.—The fear of being boiled away, or evaporated. Pinetophobia.—The fear that trees in an orchard or pine forest have not been planted in rows. Vacuophobiu.—The fear of Sunday, empty ballrooms, etc. Quaquaversophobia.—The fear of not having an excuse to be the first to leave. Philomelaphobia. -The fear of invisible birds. Of all these, the last is by far the most terrifying. It is difficult to imagine anything more harrowing than having to live in an imaginary world filled with the flutter of many millions of invisible wings, and noisy with the twitterings of a vast multitude of unseen bird-throats. The fear of a gentle caress on the back of the neck from a ghostly pinion is one that has caused sufferers from this most distressing mental ailment to rise and leave parties without warning, and my Aunt Carrie informs me that a stockbroker of her acquaintance was once carried screaming from Leadenhall Street on account of a sudden attack of this phobia. It appears that he was wearing a was perfectly clear, the dread of invisible pigeons was too much for him. With the aid of a rather inadequate Latin dietionary. I have prepared a short statement of some of the more important phobias to which persons who live in Sarawak are peculiarly liable. Is yours on the list? Collybophobia.—The fear of bankers. Aestuariophobia.—The fear, when up-river, of being suddenly called down-river. Summaftuminephobia.—The fear, when downriver. of having to go up-river. Porcocluncphobia.— The fear of hogs’ rumps. Vinophobia.—The fear of running out of claret. Phasianophobia.—The fear of Fire-back pheasants. Voragnephobia.—The fear, when shooting a rapid, that the steersman of the boat has been left behind drunk at the last Dayak house. Hispanophobia.—The fear of talking Spanish too fast. Icthyophobia.—The fear of finding fish in the pockets of one's trousers. Plebeiophobia.—The fear of being forced to share one's house with someone who has not been to a public school. Caseophobia.—The fear of large cheeses. Alibiphobia.—The fear that one is not in Sarawak at all, but in Singapore, or Paris. Limacephobia.—The fear of small, dead slugs. You may suffer from any or all of these ills in Sarawak, but even if you have the whole bunch, there comes always that glorious moment when, as you hop into bed and draw the mosquito curtains, you know for certain that you are safe, for the time being, from the unwelcome attentions of invisible birds. If thc anopheles mosquito has done nothing else*, he has at least done that. PRECIOUS SMILES. Fashionable New York dentists now use gold fillings with tiny stones of brilliant inset on the top of the tooth. The innovation is being jointly advertised by dentists and jewellers. New York society has fully accepted it, and the "brilliant" smile has become frequent.—Sunday Dispatch. Mrs. Wilbur J. Botts, who stands high in New York's social register, lias had three of her front teeth removed and replaced by square-cut emeralds, states a well-known American gossip-writer Her arrival at a party is now heralded by Hashes of green fire, which scintillate around her whenever she laughs or talks; and since she is laughing or talking pretty well all the time, the result is apt to be a trifle overpowering. Mrs. Hutts, however, has since been outdone by a certain Miss Evelyn Van Pippen, who has had her tongue bored as though for earings, and who now sports a superb collection of cats-eyes, opals, chalcedonies, sapphires and amethysts on the end of it. The only trouble is that she can neither eat in the ordinary way. nor speak, but a correspondent informs me that she is rapidly becoming proficient in the deaf and dumb alphabet, and is making arrangements to receive nourishment through a tube. It is considered merely a question of time before the smartest New York women will be wearing wooden platters let into their lips in the manner of certain West African belles. TIGHT SPOT.

A man was charged nt Sheffield Police Court yesterday with using obscene language to a clockwork mouse which refused to perform on the pavement.— Manchester Guardian. *He has done a lot.—ED. First Division News. JANUARY. Fifty-seven civil and sixty-eight criminal cases came before the Kuching Courts during January. Of the hitter, twenty-two were for breaches of Municipal bye-laws. At an inquest into the death of a Chinese, named Chong Ah Ann, who was run over and killed by a lorry, a verdict of accidental death duo to negligence on the part of the lorry driver was recorded. The lorry driver was subsequently charged with "Causing death by a rash act" under section 301A of the Sarawak Penal Code, found guilty, and fined $50. Compensation to the value of $200 was awarded to the widow of deceased. The Assistant District Officer, Mr. G. F. J. Pegler, proceeded to Lundu by m.l. Betty on January 28th, and was still away at the end of the month. The man who was found wandering along the coast in the vicinity of Telok Sarabang during December has now been identified. While under observation in the General Hospital, he was recognized as a son of Amat bin Merah of Kampong Main. Kuching. According to the latter, his son left Kuching nine years ago intending to sail to Miri. While off Kuala Baram, the boat was wrecked, and it was then thought there were no survivors. Inquiries have, however, failed to elicit any information as to the son's whereabouts and mode of existence since his original departure from Kuching. Seventy logs of kruik wood were shipped from Lundu to Kuching during the month. The District Officer, Serian and Samarahan, reports that Kampong Lobang Batu lost their share Sunong Belabor as they failed to arrive on the day appointed for gathering. The nests were brought to Seriab by the Native Officer and people from Kampong Semabang, and sent for miction to Kuching, where a very much better price was obtained than any offers made locally. During the District Officer’s visit to the Ulu Sadong this month he tried to persuade the owners of birdsnests' caves to bring the nests to him, and told them that he would have them auctioned in Kuching and obtain better prices for them. All owners of caves in the Ulu Sadong have large debts to Chinese traders at Serian. who give them low prices and exchange provisions for the nests. Two band Dayaks were fined according to Land Dayak custom for taking on a second wife before divorcing the first. Kampong Mentu had a land dispute with Kampong Lobang Batu in which Lobang Batu people were found to be preparing to farm this year in Mentu land. The harvest of 1935 failed badly in the Ulu Sadong, with the result that all Kampongs except Temong and Koran have been living on krebang and bandong for some months. The Dayaks, however, have taken a stoic view of the failure of the rice crop, and no complaints or requests for Government assistance have been received. The fruit season, however, has again been fairly good in parts. The padi all over the Serian district is very good, and in the Ulu Sadong will be ready for harvesting during February. At Mentong, Mayang and Mentu the Dayaks have a system of irrigation : the low-lying land is flooded a month after they have planted out their padi by partly damming up the small streams traversing that land. They thereby turn empran hind into swamp, but nt the same time keep a stream of fresh water running through their farm. This flooding obviates the necessity of weeding, and it has been noticed that the padi in these three districts is really excellent. Some of the Serian traders have started to erect their shophouses in the new bazaar. The Kuching- Simanggang Road on the Kuching side of the Samarahan bridge has recently been very bad, and at the end of the month there was no rice, kerosene oil. tobacco or salt left in the bazaar. From the Samarahan to Serian the road is passable, and so some traders have been having their stores sent by boat from Kuching through Loba Blat to the Samarahan, and then brought from there by lorry. No motor cars have been able to get through for six weeks. The District Officer, Serian and Sadong, reports as follows on a tour of part of bis district : "I visited Tebekang on 15th—16th and the Ulu Sadong, right and left-hand branches, from 17th to 30th during which time every kampong (36) and Chinese settlement was visited with the exception of Kampongs Dalia, Angkroh, Tcmah and Taup. At every kampong the inhabitants were informed about the tapping holiday and the new tuba fishing order, and I again explained to them how they are gradually forgetting their old customs through lack of competent bead of district. Fines for divorce, adultery and various tabus vary in different kampongs, and there are very few of the 114 Orang Kayas, Pengarahs, and Penglimas who really know their own adat. The anak buah admit very little authority of the Orang Kayas, who arc content to have their orders disobeyed rather than ask the Native Officer or District Officer to see them enforced. “I was surprised, however, to find that all kampongs had been cleaned up just before my arrival, and the policy of trying to get the Dayaks to take some pride in their villages and get a spirit of competition amongst them seems to have met with more success than I had anticipated. Kampongs Sungan, Bengali, Kntebu and eight doors of Sejijak were fined $1 a door as they had made no attempt to rebuild their houses or repair them as ordered last August. These small fines, I am sure, will have the desired effect of making them realize (as I told them last August) that their district is going to be travelled every three and six months by the Native Officer and District Officer respectively. 1 hope that in a few months, if the election of an Orang Kaya Temonggong of each district is later approved, the present chaotic state of affairs in the Ulu Sadong will be straightened out. ‘The Orang Kaya of Pichin and Krosen accompanied me on the whole tour.” Two inquests were held at Bau during January, and in both cases verdicts of death by misadventure were returned. The District Officer, Hau, states that two cases of attempted arson were reported during January at Siniawun. The first attempt was on the house of Chop "Nam Fah," a former Paku trader, in whose house the Paku, fire began. The second was made on a house next to that occupied by ex-Paku traders. The Siniawan Chinese community are somewhat alarmed, and every effort is being made to prevent further outbreaks, and to trace the criminals rcsponsible for the previous efforts. Anti-malarial work at Bau continues. A survey was conducted by Sanitary Inspector Brodie, and certain actions recommended in his report have been noted for attention early in February. The Principal Medical Officer paid two visits to the district during the month. Three hundred and twenty-one persons were treated in the Bau Dispensary and Hospital during the month. Seventy-six injections were given, chiefly for yaws. The question of the land dispute between the Senah Dayaks and the Dutch Dayaks was again brought up during a recent visit on the part of the District Officer to the Left Hand Branch. The Orang Kaya was informed that the matter had been referred to the Resident, First Division, and that no action could be taken pending instructions. Orang Kaya Japar expressed his intention of appealing against a land decision given in September last, and was informed that it was too late to appeal. All chiefs are being informed of the tuba fishing regulations and tapping holiday dates as and when an opportunity occurs. The padi harvest in Upper Sarawak promises to be fair. Dahan Rubber Estate harvested 27,000 lbs. dry rubber during January. Rainfall at Bau was 11.92 inches, and at Dalian 15.8 inches. Trade conditions at Siniawan were investigated during the month, and it was found that gold played a very minor part in the life of the trading community as a whole, rubber being the mainstay of the area. Numerous applications for robber dealers’ licences were received; applicants were informed that no new issues would be recommended for the present. The District Officer, Bau. accompanied by the Native Officer and Dresser, visited the Left Hand Branch during the month, proceeding as far as Senah Negri. The output of gold for December from the Upper Sarawak mines was 2,133,666 ozs., slightly below the November figure. The price remained steady. The following table gives the individual output of gold from the various mines for December :— Tennis. MIXED DOUBLES CHAMPIONSHIP. Semi-final.—Mrs. Kelley and Kitto beat Dayang Valerie and Benson 6—3, 6—4. Mrs. Pitt-Hardacre and Mitchell to play Mrs. Kelley and Kitto in the final. All golf and tennis players are reminded that there will be a meeting at the Club on 12th March to discuss proposed improvements to the golf-course and the tennis courts. Badminton. MIXED DOUBLES. First Round.—Mrs. Kelley and Harding beat Mrs. Daubeny and W. J. Chater. Mrs. Pollard and Birt beat Dayang Valerie and Daubeny. Mrs. Gibson and Calvert beat Mrs. Pitt- Hardacre and Pollard. Second Round.—Mrs. Gibson and Calvert beat Mrs. Pollard and Birt. Second Division News. JANUARY. Towards the end of the month a number of counterfeit five-cent pieces dated 1927 were found in circulation in Simanggang bazaar. Four women who were in possession of some of these coins were prosecuted, but discharged. A Chinese who is alleged to have distributed a one-dollar packet of these coin's has absconded and is still at large. A warrant has been issued for his arrest. It is thought that these coins originated in Kuching. 300 out-patients were treated in Simanggang Government dispensary during January, and 182 N.A.B. injections were administered. Mr. Dare. Senior Agricultural Officer, arrived at Simanggang on January 15th, and on the 18th, accompanied by the Resident, he visited Tabarong Skrang, where the four Government subsidised pepper gardens were inspected. At Enteban arrangements were made for preparing a demonstration vegetable garden for Dayaks. Mr. Dare returned to Kuching on the 21st. On January 16th M.L. Santosa arrived at Simanggang, having been chartered by Government for three months in order to replace M.L. Rentis, which is being repaired at Brooke Dock. Owing to rise in price of jelutong a large number of permits were taken out in Simanggang and Lingga during the month. The District Officer, Saribas, reports that as a result of the report of rebel activities in the Ulu Spok, Penghulus Igoh and Mandal Chaing were called to Betong on the 7th. These two, accompanied by a squad of Constabulary, proceeded up river to call down Tuai Rumah and others suspected of harbouring rebels; the party returned on the 12th and proceeded to Simanggang the. folllowing day. It is understood that the enquiry is still adjourned. It was considered advisable to cease issuing rice on loan to distressed Dayak, and the balance of over a hundred sacks was sold for cash. Reports were received from Udau Paku of a serious epidemic, five deaths having occurred in one house during the monh. The Drawer twice visited Udau and reported an epidemic of influenza, death in all cases being due to bronchial pneumonia. Free treatment was given to affected persons, and preventive medicines were issued to all Dayaks in the vicinity. Reports on this year's padi in the Betong district continue to be satisfactory, and in many parts the harvest is expected to commence early in March. Pengarah Nyalu and Penghulu Undum visited Baratok during January. The opportunity was taken to discuss various points of Dayak adat. The Native Officer, Engkilili. reports with regret the death, which took place on January 11th, of Tay Kai Hiang, Capitan China of Engkilili. His funeral was attended by a large number of people including the Government staff and the Capitan China of Simanggang. Simanggang Notes. Youth, 'tis said, must be served—but why, oh why, should it always want the first helping? Well, well, "gather ye roses while ye may” for the hours "Pereunt et Imputantur.” Having got under weigh with this brilliant (and, I believe, original) aphorism, let us "once more into the breach, dear friends." The sluggish slothfulness induced by Christmas and New Year fare having more or less faded into the limbo of time, Simanggang, indeed most of the Batang Lupar population, bestirred itself to enjoy a Regatta chiefly remarkable for its lack of incident. The banks of the river from below the old Fort right round to Kampong Lemanak were lined with bangkongs and racing-boats of all sizes and descriptions, including one hermaphroditic excrescence. Belalang Munggu by name, which was neither one nor the other, and yet a bit of both. Fortunately this boat was never nearer to the winner than the last boat in such races as it participated in, so much acrimonious discussion was saved. The bazaar itself look on the aspect of Piccadilly Cirens on an International Night (Rugby football, of course !), although in all fairness to Simanggang it should be said that there was an infinitely smaller percentage of drunks in the bazaar than is usual at Home—this is the more remarkable when it is known that that heaven-designed and man-made place known as a "bar" was made free to all and sundry. Dayaks who, during the year, had wasted their own time, anil Government officers leisure, by appearing at their houses at any time betwen 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. and heralding their approach with a husky cough and a demand for ngirop. at last had their desires satisfied to the utmost of their capacity, and that, as our American cousins would have it, is "saying some." There bad been a general request tor an oily pig, but the Resident, feeling that an illustrious predecessor had set too high a standard of entertainment by falling into a ditch while endeavouring to break up a fight occasioned by this form of amusement, decided that this should not be Eheu fugaces;—December 1930 wasn't it, oh Optimistic Fiddler? The greasy pole proved no more difficult than usual, but the ducks were of staunch breed. The swift-flowing tide held no terrors for them, and they headed for the further shore with the confidence of a Columbus. Une misguided bird set off for Engkilili, and would without the slightest doubt have reached there, had not a praku gone out and chased it back. To the annoyance and chagrin of the swimmers, as it neared the share, a Malay, dressed in a beautiful blue blazer, creased white trousers, and a panama hat, regardless of his sartorial elegance, leapt into the water and secured the prize. Jupiter Pluvius proved kind—in fact he showed a tact seldom displayed by his satellite, the Clerk of the Weather, for having granted brilliant sunshine during the races, with the approach of evening a gentle shower started that merged into a downpour. No doubt this helped to damp the ardour of the more alcoholically inclined spirits. No description of the Regatta would be complete without some mention of the Travelling Talkies (horrid word!) that were in operation during January. Being only an ordinary soul and no film critic, I am forced to admit that the films, antique and inconsequent as they were, were hugely enjoyed by everyone. The Censor had done his best to make the longer films even more unintelligent and wildly improbable than they were when they left Hollywood icons ago, and to bis credit be it said that he undeniably had succeeded. The star-piece of those shown was the story, in twelve parts, of a circus, and twelve times did the long-suffering audience have to undergo the torture of reading through the names of actors, producers, photographers and those other officials whose names usually appear on the prologue. The incessant chatter, crying of children, and the expectorations and syncopations of several Chinese gentlemen who appeared to be afflicted with St. Vitus' Dance did not help to make an already almost unintelligible talking projector any the better, but in spite of these small drawbacks everyone went hack again and again. The best part of the show happened when the Resident's dogs, also regular attenders, became annoyed with a barking compatriot on the screen, and in their humble way, drew the best laugh of the Regatta, as in 1930 did—but no! that happened in 1980. If. in the cause of entertainment, any small exaggerations or divergencies from the exact truth have crept into my narrative, the pardon of anyone who may feel hurt or maligned is humbly asked. And lastly the thanks of the public are due to two people—to Mr. Dare, who fortunately found it convenient to visit Simanggang with his launch, and which, incidently, proved to be of inestimable value for umpiring,—and to Mr. Eng Yaw Huat for his masterly running of the whole Regatta. THE BUTLER. Psychic Phenomena in Simanggang. MYSTERIOUS FOOTSTEPS. The following has been sent to us by a Simanggang correspondent: The "Astana" at Simanggang has recently been the scene of some rather queer events. There are two explanations available, and readers may accept whichever appeals the most. Shortly, the facts are these. The occupier of the house, and his servants, have on several occasions heard sound through the stillness of the. night the soft pad of slow stately footsteps and the complaining creak of a loose board. Immediate investigations in and around the house have revealed—nothing! An occupied bedroom that had not been locked the evening before was found in the morning to be locked from the outside. And that night no footsteps were heard. Although the present building is a relatively new erection, all the tiangs. floor boards, walls and roof were taken from the old Astana, which was demolished in 1930 to make room for the new offices. It may be that these manifestations are the outcome of a practical joke, but the romantic associations of Simanggang with the early history of Sarawak and its White Rajahs leads one to hope that the explanation is not to be found in this direction. That a ghost walked in the Kubu Lama is undisputed : Has it changed its habitation? Third Division News. JANUARY. Forty-four civil and sixty-three criminal eases came before the Sibu Courts during January. Three Coroner’s inquests were held at Sibu during the month. The first was an inquiry into the death by drowning of a Chinese (Kheh) who slipped off a jelatong on the bank of the main river, while bathing, and disappeared, the body being recovered several days Inter. The second was an inquiry into the drowning of a Foochow, whose boat wits upset in a sudden squall. The third was upon the body of a female child (apparently Chinese) aged about 4 years, which was found floating in the river. No information or police report was forthcoming, and the body was in too advanced a stage of decomposition to determine the cause of death. An open verdict was returned. On January 13th news was received that Kudang, who, it will be remembered, was concerned in the brutal murder of a family of Chinese in the ulu Binatang during 1935. had been killed by Katibas Dayaks, and that two outlaws named Makati and Sirai had been captured. A few days later Wan Bujang, Native Officer, arrived at Sibu. accompanied bv Penghulus Sirai and Briak, and fifty of their followers; Sirai and Makau were brought up in the District Court, charged and remanded for trial by the Resident's Court. The total land revenue for the Third Division for December amounted to $14,747.56, which shows an increase of $5,917.00 (approximately) over the previous month. Thirty-nine applications for land including one building lot. were received during January, this being a decrease of twenty over the previous month. 199 deeds were registered, and registration fees and stamp duty amounted to $748.27. The following table gives the Sibu and Kanowit trade figures for January :— The old Sibu hospital has been demolished, and the Constabulary quarters on Island Road have been converted into a temporary hospital. Demarcation of the new hospital site was completed, and work is now in progress on the foundation. Forest Ranger Pendek paid another visit to the Pelagus area and surveyed S. Arak, connecting up with the ulu Datong Kanan, and closing on his former survey at N. Russa (Latong). The Divisional Forest Officer visited the Bukit Lima reserve on two occasions, to inspect felling areas and to try and induce the licensee to fell with axe and saw instead of axes only. After a demonstration to show economic stumping, lie adopted the former method. The Divisional Forest Officer also inspected the Taungya plot which is making good progress. Another area of just over one acre was taken up at the end of the month by a market gardener for growing vegetables; this area is adjacent to. and will be treated in the same way as, the previous Taungya plot. The Divisional Forest Officer visited the Kanowit Sawmill on the 17th with the local manager of the Borneo Campany. Sawing has been stopped until the arrival of the new machinery. Eighty-six patients were treated at Sibu hospital during the month. Of this number fifty-two were admissions, and the remainder were from the previous month. Four hundred and seventy-six cases were treated in the out-patient department, and seventy-six N.A.B. injections were administered. The total rainfall for the month was 15.98 inches, the highest recorded within 24 hours Iwing 2.13 inches. The Sibu Police Barracks, which have been converted into a temporary hospital, were occupied on the 11th. Accommodation in this temporary hospital is. however, limited, and some cases which should normally be treated in hospital are being treated at home as outpatients. The building, however, is self-contained, and with the limited staff this is an advantage. On January 21st news was received al Sibu that His Majesty King George V had passed away. All flags were immediately half-masted ; mourning was worn by all Europeans until Tuesday the 28th, the day of His late Majesty’s funeral, when two minutes’ silence was observed. All European and Native Officers attended at the flagstaff for the observance of the silence. Government offices being closed. On January 22nd R.A.F. Flying Boat No. K-4581 arrived at 4.20 p in. The Officers were :—Squadron Leader K. B. Lloyd A.P.C. (in command), Squadron Leader R. A. George, Flying Officer D. Michell, and Wing Commander Jagoe. Senior R.A.F. Chaplain. Far East. Mr. G. C. R. Franks of Singapore, was a passenger aboard the Flying Boat, which remained at Sibu for two nights, and left for Kuching on the 24th at 9.10 a.m. As is usual immediately before a tapping holiday, Sibu was crowded with Dayaks who bad come in to dispose of their rubber. Tn addition to these people, the men who had garrisoned the five blockhouses in the Katibas and Ga’at rivers arrived at Sibu to be paid off. There was considerable merry-making in the bazaar, and the Constabulary are to be commended for the tactful and efficient manner in which they controlled the situation. On Friday the 24th, Chinese New Year, the usual salute of seven guns was fired from the Fort Battery. Mr. A. L. MeLaine, accompanied by Mrs. MeLaine, returned from casual leave on January 7th. Mr. F. L. Mansel, who had been temporarily, stationed at Sibu, returned to Kuching on the 9th. Mr. B. Summers, Land and Survey Department, arrived on January loth to relieve Mr. R. N. Baron, who proceeded to Kuching on the 22nd. Mr. A. G. Taylor visited Sibu during the month on short leave. In the Bankruptcy Court at Sarikci the estate of Chop Hock Eng Hong was wound up, notice of appeal being given by the biggest creditors. The partners of Chop Kong Heng Chong of Sarikei were adjudicated bankrupt on their own petition. In Sarikei District Coort a Malay was sentenced to 6 months' rigorous imprisonment for theft from a dwelling house, and five Dayaks were sentenced for house-breaking. The District Officer, Lower Rejang, reports that a Chinese committed suicide by hanging himself from the verandah rail of the unoccupied European bungalow at Binatang. Apparently, he had been depressed at the recent suicide at Kanowit of one of the Wayang girls, with whom he hail an affair. A verdict of suicide while of unsound mind was returned. The Matu Police Barracks were broken into on the night of the 14th, and the property of a village constable stolen. The thief or thieves have not yet been traced. The District Officer, Lower Rejang, reports with the deepest regret the death of Abang Haji Ahmat Barlian bin Abang Haji Metair, Native Officer of Rejang. After successive attacks of fever, Abang Haji Ahmat was sent to Sibu on the 13th January for medical treatment but succumbed on the 26th. The funeral took place at Binatang, and was attended by all Administrative Officers of the Lower Rejang District. Abang Haji Ahmat Barlian was the head of the leading Malay family of Binatang. After many years of unofficial service, he succeeded his father as Tua Kampong in 1929, and was promoted Native Officer in 1933. doing duty at Binatang and Rejang. An officer of the old type, he was loyal and industrious, and highly respected by all communities. His untimely death at the age of 52 cuts short a life devoted to the service of His Highness the Rajah. T.arge numbers of Dayaks came down to Sarikei and Binatang when they received the news that they could once more buy cartridges. They all seemed to have plenty of money, and did not complain about lack of rice, as most of them appear to make an adequate living from their small rubber gardens. Dayak padi in the Lower Rejang area is again suffering badly from the ravages of rats and mice. Rat poison has been issued free to all Dayak applicants. During January the Agricultural Assistant arrived in the Sarikei district to make an inspection of rubber plantations. A piece of land adjoining the offices was cleared, stumped, and dug over for making an experimental vegetable garden, which will be started as soon as seeds arrive from Kuching. Construction of the downstream end of Sarikei wharf was almost completed by the end of January. The main concrete structure of Binatang godown was completed during the month, brickwork made satisfactory progress, and work was started on the roof truss. Earth filling to floor level is well in hand. The s.s. Ban Ho Leong, a vessel owned by a Chinese firm in Singa|>ore, is now attempting to capture some of the trade between the Rejang river and Singapore. She is a converted Thames barge, and sails under the Chinese flag. Owing to the varied nationalities of her officers and crew, it is rumoured that she is known in Singapore us tbe "League of Nations.” Stormy weather was experienced on the coast, accompanied by rain and floods. The bandongs hound from Kuching to Second Division ports were driven out of their course, and just managed to make shelter at Bruit after jettisoning all their cargo. The District Officer, Kapit, reports that Mong, a Dayak, was fined $50 or three months in default for spreading false rumours to the effect that Unya reported drowned near Belaga. had really been killed by Kayans; these rumours necessitated Native Officer Abang Ahmat and Penghulu Temunggong Koh visiting Belaga to calm down Dayaks, who were going to bales on the Kayans. Investigations were made into the Belaga report that a Kayan woman, who had died in childbirth, had been buried together with the living child in accordance with the old custom. It appeared that the child had been born prematurely, was not properly formed, and only lived for a short time; it was already dead when buried. 179 patients were treated at Kapit Government dispensary during the month. Among these was one of the Kayans who was wounded m the Pelagus affair, when a party of Kayans and Malays were attacked by outlaws. He requested the dresser to extract some of the shot which he had received, and which was now beginning to trouble him ; this was done, and it turned out that they were No. 6. and not buckshot, as was originally supposed. Penghulus Atan, Sibat, Grinang, T. Koh, Jugah, Ugak, Entili and Manok Manchal visited Kapit during the month, and Penghulus Sirai, Briak and Bedimbab visited Song. On January 27th Penghulu Puso arrived from Belaga with about sixty Kayans, Kejamans. Skapans and others. Three nights before reaching Kapit they had moored to the bank for the night when a storm arose, and during the night a tree fell on tho boat. The Kayans thought they were attacked by munsoh as in the Pelagus affair, and prepared for a fight with parangs; however no outlaws materialised, and they soon found out the true state of affairs. The prahu was broken beyond repair, but the occupants had lucky escapes, and apart from minor injuries came to no serious hurt. On January 11th Penghulus Sirai, Briak and Bedimbab with a bala of 50 arrived at Song with news of the death of Kudang, a murderer and outlaw. They proceeded to Sibu, returning on 16th. On the 17th Native Officer Abang Indeh with five police and fifteen levies proceeded up the Katibas to Padang Woh for further investigation into the Kudang affair. They were still away at end of the month. Penghulu Grinang received permission to take a bala of fifteen men up the Ulu Gat and to the Kanyau district to look for rebels. On January 9th, instructions were received for the withdrawal of all patrols and levies from Ga'at and Katibas blockhouses. This has been done. Towards the end of the month early harvesting had started in some areas in the Kapit district; crops on the whole are only moderate, and rata and birds, especially the former, are reported to have done more damage than usual. Most of the padi at Belaga is a failure, and disease has killed off much that had already grown to a reasonable height. The fall in the price of rattan resulted in very little being exported from Song or Kapit during January. An unfortunate accident occurred during the month at Mukah, a girl pupil of the convent school being killed as the result of falling down a well. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned at the subsequent inquest, and the well has since been covered in. The District Officer, Mukah, reports that during a visit to the Ulu he observed that the general health of the Dayaks, particularly the children, was very poor. In his opinion this is chiefly due to poor diet, and also to lack of medical facilities. One Dayak who had been suffering for about two years from what appeared to be an acute mastoid abscess was brought down-river and sent to Sibu hospital. Ninety-six patients wore treated at Mukah Government dispensary during the month, and twenty-three N.A.B. injections were administered. All Dayak houses in the ulu Mukah except those m the ulu Selangau have finished their 1935 padi and are eating sago or else borrowing padi from Selangau houses. The Dayaks state that this year's padi crop will be a failure, owing to an abnormal plague of rats and mice. They asked for rat poison, but it doubtful if this could be supplied in sufficient quantity to do any good. It therefore appears that there is some possibility of a rice famine probably towards the end of this year. Several Dayak padi-farms in the ulu were inspected ; the soil for the most part is poor, and the padi in consequence is stunted. In many houses there is a genuine lack of good land. The new Chinese school at Dalat was officially opened by the District Officer on the morning of January 22nd. The school is situated behind Dalat Bazaar and has three large class-rooms, also accommodation for masters, etc. Fortunately, there is ample room for playing fields to be laid out in the vicinity. The school is a fine building, well planned and well constructed, and is a real credit to the Chinese community of Dalat. There were present at the opening ceremony the Rev. Fathers A. Mulder and C. Epping. Mr. Chua Hoi Tiaw, Capitan China, Dalat. Awang Bunyok, Native Officer, together with the teaching staff and a number of local Towkays. It is understood that the school will be known in future as the Chin Hua School, and not "Hong Mong," as the old school was named. A scheme has been prepared for the collection of subscriptions for Oya Mosque which is at present in a very bad state of repairs. A meeting to discuss this scheme was held on January 20th, the mosque officials and the heads of the Melanau Islam community being present. The District Officer, Oya and Dalat reports that padi and jagong are doing well in the ulu Oya and the Dayaks hope for a good harvest. Penghulu Untol came down during the month with new logs for the Oya landing stage, and reported all well in his district. The price of raw sago dropped again during January, the price at Dalat being 46 cents per passu, and at S. Kut 54 cents per passu. The amount of raw sago exported from the district decreased slightly as compared with December. The figures were :— By Sea 30 koyans. By S. Kut 151 „ Fourth Division News. JANUARY. No crime of any importance was committed in Limbang district during the month. A few Kelabits visited Limbang during January, being brought down from the Medihit by Mr. and Mrs. Davidson, of the Borneo Evangelical Mission. Early in the month a large number of Dayaks came to Limbang for cock-fighting. A meeting is held only once or twice a year in this district, but when it does take place it is always well attended. The ulu Limbang and Lubai people competed against Dayaks from Temburong, Panderuan and Berawan. A considerable, number of durians were brought round from Trusan and put on the market at Limbang. but no trees fruited in the Limbang river. Swamp padi crops, which appear very satisfactory, were ripening by the end of the month, and the harvest has commenced. Owing to suspected smuggling of rubber from Brunei and Temburong into Limbang. and from British North Borneo into Merapok and Lawas. the promises of all rubber exporters and dealers in the district were searched. Four convictions for breaches of Rubber Restriction Orders insulted. Below are extracts from a report by Mr. H. E. Cutfield. District Officer. Limbang and Lawas, on a visit to the Dayaks and Tagals in Sungei Labai and Sungei Ukong :— "Accompanied by Up-river Agent Jaya and one Village Constable I left Limbang by boat at 7 a.m. on January 1st, 1936. "The lower part of 8. Lubai is of little use for farming, buffalo halamans or any other useful purpose, and consequently there are few inhabitants, but I was surprised to learn that one house of two doors of Muruts were living in a sidestream quite near the mouth. “Up the Limbang it is nearly four hours by launch before the Malay Kampongs and land are passed, then come the Bisayahs, and then the Murota, so that a Murut house within an hour and a half of the Fort was a complete surprise. "All Tagul and Dayak-Tagal houses were visited, and their Tuai collected, and we arrived at Rumah Chupoh (Dayak-Tagal) about 4.30 p.m. Here we spent the night, the Tuai of all houses below this or their representatives being present. These people do not get good harvests, and have already had to buy rice, which is not the case of people living in the Ulu Lubai. Chupoh and his house, I believe, are industrious, but always short of rice. However, they have a certain amount of rubber as a compensation. In the evening an aum was held which lusted until about 1 a.m. "On the unanimous selection of the Tagals, who were all present. Ampar was selected head of the house in place of Semayoh. who is at present serving a sentence of imprisonment for incest. "Owing to a weak defence put up by Semayoh when convicted of this offence, the Tagals were asked if they had any objection to Dayak customs, which they are expected to follow, of- if they would prefer the introduction of their own customs. Their reply was of interest, since they were very emphatic and decisive in their opinion that they wished to follow Dayak adat and Dayak adat only "I naturally asked them if they understood and wore conversant with Dayak customs. They replied 'Oh yes, we learnt adat. Iban in B.N.B. before we came here, from the few Sarawak Kampar Dayaks who have settled there and married our women.' They are not a prepossessing crowd, and seem very slow-witted and appear to look up to the Iban, but they are very willing, and given more favourable land and opportunities, might be very useful people; they will not. however, go far on their own initiative. Some more are moving here from Merapok, Lawas, after this harvest, but they have not picked very favourable land. "On January 21st, 1936, I left Rumah Chupoh at 6.30 a.m. and called at all houses. Above here houses become more frequent, but the actual river banks are too deeply flooded to lie of any use. and all houses are some way inland. About an hour and a half was spent at Rumah Ubong at midday. These people are well off for padi and rubber. I arrived at Rumah Penghulu Wee (the last house up the Lubai) about 5 p.m. : the welcome here with cannons, crackers, krumong. etc., was almost excessive, but unavoidable. The Lubai has, I think, been rather neglected. The Borneo Evangelical Mission have built a small house here, and Mr. and Mrs. Tolley were in residence, but us I had brought up their mail, and they had not had one for six weeks, they were not disappointed when I had to refuse their kind invitation to an evening meal. "The night at Penghulu Wee's house, of course, meant a whole night’s sitting, and day-light and another bath dispersed the party. Business was attended to before the crowd became unmanageable. "On January 22nd. I left Rumah Penghulu Wee's at 7.30 a.m. by boat for the short distance to the Pengkalan, and then travelled overland, arriving at Ukong at 12.45. Penghulu Sisal and a number of Bisayahs were present. In the afternoon, since the representatives of the Limbang Bisayahs and the Lubai Dayaks were present, the boundary between their two lands was discussed. Up-river Agent Jaya had been on this for some time, as it had always been a bone of contention where the Limbang (Bisayah) buffalo land ended, and the Lubai (Dayak) farming land began; at one place the extent of land between the two rivers is not great and buffalos (untethered) can do a considerable amount of damage. The Bisayahs had field out for a boundary originally laid down by Mr. Ricketts. "This boundary was only provisional. and at the time neither rivers wished to spread so far. Also this was before the Dayak influx into this district on a large scale, and the Lubai was almost entirely uninhabited. Jaya, alter full consideration, hud made out another boundary. This was fully discussed in the afternoon, when the. contestants were asked to retire and discuss the matter under the supervision of their respective Ppnghulus, Wee and Sisal. They returned to the Court at 6 p.m. and expressed themselves entirely satisfied with the new boundarv. A regulation was also laid down that Dayaks farming near the boundary were responsible for the erection of fences sufficient to protect their farms from buffalo as they are the last to arrive and the land originally belonged to the Bisayahs. This was agreed to, and the arrangement was recorded. "On January 23rd, I left by M. L. Sylvia at 7 a.m., called at Kuala Bidan to inspect and approve the site for a sago factory, and arrived al Limbang at 11.45 a.m." Lawas (Sarawak) Estates, Ltd., exported 31,360 lbs. of dry rubber during January. The Assistant District Officer, Lawas and Trusan. reports that his district, not even excluding Sundar, has been extraordinarily well-behaved for some months past. This, while very satisfactory from one point of view, has its disadvantages, since the resulting emptiness of the jail is making the task of keeping the station neat and tidy increasingly difficult. In the absence of any candidate for the existing vacancies in Lawas prison, it is probable that use will have to be made at intervals of casual labour. At Miri, work was commenced during January on a new cutting for the Tanjong Lobang Hill Hoad. The work wilt cut out the dangerous ‘‘8” bend on this road, and will materially shorten it. The following are the trade and customs figures for Miri for January :— During January the District Officer, Bintulu, made an extensive tour of the Tuban. Jelalong, Labang, Pandan and Sebungan rivers. He reports that the Dayaks and other natives seem prosperous and contented. The outlook for the padi crop, however, is very bad,—hi some eases the padi will not be worth harvesting. A plague of rats and mice appears to have caused great damage to crops throughout the whole district. The new kampong scheme across the Sebiew River at Bintulu is milking satisfactory progress, tails have now been demarcated and are being readily taken up. The following are the trade and customs figures for Bintulu for January :— Work has been commenced on the final cleaning of the Bintulu landing ground. This includes the final removal of all stumps, roots, logs, and other obstructions from under the surface; these are heaped with the peaty top-soil, ready for burning, and the result will eventually be used as a top dressing. The District Officer, Barnin, accompanied by Tuanku Mohamad, Native Officer, left the station on January 17th to attend the Punan meetings, and was still away at the end of the month. CORRESPONDENCE. [The Editor is not responsible for the opinions of correspondents.] KUCHING, 18th February, 1936. To the Editor, . Rm, I have made another excursion to Upper Sarawak in the Bidi-Krokong district, and noticing the prevalence of Kepla trees it occurred to me that then is possibility of an industry which could be carried on by the Dayak population with considerable benefit to themselves. Distillation of the wood and roots of these trees would yield an nil of the type of the Sassafras oil obtained in the U.S.A, which finds a ready market in Europe. The Dayak people, so dexterous with the parang, could reduce the wood to chips, and primitive distilling apparatus could be devised, which they could make and operate. It is some Unity years since I handled Sassafras oil. but I believe, that the oil to he got from Kepla trees would be superior to the Sassafras oil that came into the market at that rather distant period. If any of my experience in getting essential oils, can be applied for the benefit of the Dayak people, it would be willingly given. I have also had brought to my notice a specimen of a salt, which was found to he Tincal, or native Sodium Biborate. This was found in a prospecting pit close to the Bidi Road, at the Kim Hong mine, and was shown to me by Cbong Kia Ek. The Tincal occurred in a stiff clay overlaying limestone, at a depth of about six feet, which I would consider to preclude the probability of adventitious occurrence. It is therefore probable that the Borate come up in underground water, in supersaturated solution. A well-crystallized specimen was taken, and the clay from the bottom of the pit was lixiviated yielding Borax. It is not suggested that this observation is of economical value, but it may be a contribution to Geological knowledge of the district when taken together with the fact that warm subterranean waler still comes to the surface at Paku. Your obedient servant, D. JAMES. The THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1st. 1936. Local and Personal. SEPTEMBER. We understand that His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie propose to sail from Europe by P.&O. s.s. Comorin, which leaves Marseilles on October 30th. and is due to arrive at Singapore on November 20th. Her Highness the Ranee expects to follow in the Rajputana, which leaves Marseilles on November 13th. and is due in Singapore on December 4th. Mr. A. W. D. Brooke returned to Sarawak on September 7th having completed his period of secondment with the Malayan Civil Ser vice. His last appointment in Malaya was that of Acting Third Magistrate, Kuala Lumpur. On arriving at Kuching Mr. Brooke drove to the house of Mr. H. B. Crocker, Acting Government Secretary, where he was received by the members of Committee of Administra tion and Supreme Council. Mr. Crocker made a short speech in English and Malay welcoming Mr. Brooke on his return to Sarawak, and Mr. Brooke replied in a few words expressing his pleasure at being back after two very interesting and enjoyable years in Malaya. Mr. Brooke, who since his return has been dividing his time between the Secretariat and the District Office, Kuching, will probably go to Nanga Meluan early in October. On the afternoon of September 9th, the Datu Shahbandar gave a reception at his house to which were invited His Highness the Tuan Muda, Dayang Anne, Mr. A. W. I). Brooke, the Datu Imam, and a few European Government Officers and their wives. A very pleasant feature of this reception was the presence of a number of Malay ladies who mixed freely with the guests, and whose really beautiful silks and sarongs lent distinc tion to the scene. It is hoped that this is a precedent which other Malay hosts will follow. The proceedings closed with a group photograph taken on the lawn. We deeply regret to record the death of Haji Mohamed Rais, Datu Imam Tua, which occurred at his Kuching home on September 24th. The funeral took place on the follow ing day. . An obituary notice appears in another column. Mr. P. M. Adams. Resident. Second Division, handed over the affairs of his Divi sion to Mr. H. E. Cutfield, who is to act for him during his absence on furlough, on September 15th. Mr. G. R. II. Arundell handed over Lubok Antu district to Mr. F. A. Moore on the same day. Dr. W. N. Whitford, the representative in the Far East of the Rubber Manufacturers Association, U.S.A., arrived at Kuching on August 31st. and left on September 3rd. Race Week began on Monday, September 21st with the arrival in Kuching of Messrs. P. M. Adams and H. E. Cutfield, the first of the outstation visitors, apart from Mr. C. D. Adams, Resident, Third Division, who had arrived down on duty the previous Friday. The Autumn Race Meeting was very successful, as usual, and the Turf Club are to be congratulated on their efficient organization of these functions, which are always enjoyable and which provide enter tainment for all sections of the community. Other visitors from the outstations in cluded : from the First Division. Mr. and Mrs. L. K. Morse. Mr. E. H. Elam, and Abang Zamhari, Native Officer; from the Second Division, Mr. G. R. H. Arundell; and from the Third Division, Mrs. C. D. Adams and Mr. A. Macpherson. There were no visitors from the Fourth Division. In spite of the fact that an unusually small number of outstation-ites came down for the races. Race Week’ maintained its customary standard of hectic gaiety and passed off very cheerfully indeed. This was due in some measure to the presence of H.M.S. Herald, a most welcome visitor, which arrived at Pending on September 25th and left on the 29t.h. Our thanks are due to His Highness the Tuan Muda and Dayang Anne for a most enjoyable dance which took place at Astana on the night of Saturday, September 26t.h (His Highness the Rajah’s birthday), and at which almost the entire European community of Kuching, including visitors, was present. Solosa and His Band provided the music for a very pleasant evening’s entertainment. On the evening of September 28th Mr. W. F. Dick. Resident, First Division, and Mrs. Dick very kindly placed the Sylvia Cinema (including the bar !) at. the disposal of all the Europeans in Kuching who were able to attend. We have to thank Mr. and Mrs. Dick for discovering a highly original idea for large scale entertaining, and one which provided a delightful evening for the many guests who were present. Elsewhere in this issue will be found a short, account (taken from a Singapore paper) of Mr. Ong Tiang Swee’s recent visit to Singa pore,—his first for over twenty years. Mr. Ong Tiang Swee stayed with Mr. Wee Kheng Chiang, his son-in-law, at his new house at Katong. This house, which is built in the modern style, is very striking in appearance, and has its own bathing pagar. among other amenities. While in Singapore, Mr. Ong Tiang Swee visited the Old Palace of His Highness the Sultan of Johore, and was greatly interested in what he saw there. As he was leaving the Palace he happened to meet His Highness Tungku Makhota, the Regent of Johore; on hearing that Mr. Ong Tiang Swee had not ; been to Johore for more than forty years, he remarked that he should visit the State at least once a year, and not once in half a century ! Mr. Ong Tiang Swee states that he was much impressed by the turtle farm at. Kal lang, where hundreds of large turtles, each weighing between 150 and 250 katis, are kept in an enclosure ready for sale and slaughter. These turtles are apparently caught off the Dutch islands near Singapore, and are pur chased for about $7.50 per picul. Fresh turtle eggs are sometimes obtained at the farm at a price of 90 cents per hundred,—about the same as the retail price in Kuching. Mr. Ong Tiang Swee and Mr. Wee Kheng Chiang returned to Kuching by the Vyner Brooke on September 21st in order to be in time for the races. Mr. Wee Kheng Chiang left again for Singapore on October 5th. A very enjoyable feature of Race Week was the Constabulary Bangsawan, which was staged at the Depot, Kuching, on September 28th, 29th and 30th and again on Sunday, October 4th. commencing at 8.30 each even ing. The popularity of this venture was abundantly proved by the crowds which assembled each night to witness it as guests of the Constabulary; on some nights there must have been at least a thousand people present, many of whom were so eager to get a good place that they arrived two hours and more before the show was due to open. On September 29th His Highness the Tuan Muda and the Astana party attended the Bangsawan and saw an excellent performance which was enlivened by a European harmonica quintet (or was it a sextet ?) and a particularly good conjuring turn by Mr. A. W. D. Brooke.’ The thanks of all communities are due to the Constabulary officers responsible for the organization of the Bangsawan and to the per formers themselves and all others con cerned for an excellent entertainment, and one which we hope will be repeated. A short account of Air Commodore S. W. Smith’s farewell visit to Sarawak will be found in another column. Air Commodore Smith leaves Singapore to take up a home appointment on November 20th after three years in command of all Royal Air Force units in the Far East. During this period Air Commodore Smith has paid many visits to Sarawak, where he is well known, and where he will be greatly missed. We apologise to our readers for the late appearance of this issue of the Gazette; this is largely due to a sudden rush of events at the end of the month, and in the circum stances is unavoidable National Memorial to His late Majesty King George V. We publish below a circular despatch received from the Secretary of State for the Colonies through His Excellency the British Agent:— Downing Street, 12/h August, 1986. Sir, I hare. the honour to inform you that last March a Meeting was held at the Mansion House to consider proposals for a National Memorial to His late Majesty King George the Fifth. It was resolved that the memorial should take the form of a statue of His late Majesty in London in some, noble setting, and a philanthropic scheme of a specific character which would benefit the whole country and he associated with His late Majesty's name. It was further resolved that the Lord Mayor of London should be asked to issue an appeal for a Mansion House Fund to be opened for universal subscription for the expenses of the memorial and that acknowledgment of subscriptions received should be published from time to time in "The Times" and other newspapers. 2. It was subsequently recommended that for the purpose of the erection of the proposed statue a site should he acquired in Abingdon Street and Old Palace Yard which are in close proximity to West minster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament., and that the proposed statue of His Majesty should be. placed on this site immediately facing the House of Lords in specially designed surroundings. With regard to the philanthropic scheme, it was recom mended that this should take the form of fields to be acquired all over the country for recreation purposes, and that at the entrance to each of these fields there should be a distinctive gateway bearing an inscription to show- that it is one of the King George Memorial Fields. or other appropriate visible commemoration of His late Majesty. These proposals were sub mitted to His Majesty King Edward and Her Majesty Queen Mary, who were graciously pleased to signify their entirc approbation of them. 3. The Mansion House Fund has been opened, and I am informed that subscriptions are- being received not only from persons in the United Kingdom but from persons in many parts of the Empire, from British communities in foreign countries, and even from foreign countries, such as the United States of America. So far as the Colonial Empire is con cerned. I have no doubt that in many instances the question of some form of local memorial to His late Majesty is under consideration, and in such cases the inhabitants of the Colony will no doubt prefer to subscribe to the cost of the local memorial rather than to the memorial in this country. If, however, no local memorial is contemplated, many persons in the territory concerned may desire to make some contribution towards the cost of the monument which it is proposed to erect in the capital of the Empire, and even if there is to be a local memorial some individuals may like to be associated with the memorial in Westminster also. In this connection I may mention that I recently received a communication from a Colonial Governor slating that he proposed to invite the inhabitants of the Colony concerned to subscribe funds to a memorial to His late Majesty, and that he proposed to utilize the subscriptions so received for a local memorial except in cases where the donors speci fically requested that their contributions should be applied towards the cost of the national memorial in the United Kingdom. I replied that I concurred in this proposal. 4.I should be obliged if you would arrange for such publicity as you may consider necessary to be given to this matter. Subscriptions should be sent direct to the King George National Memorial Fund. The Mansion House, London, E.C.4. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, W. ORMSBY GORE. His Highness the Rajah’s Birthday. PRESENTATION OF MEDALS. GUARD OF HONOUR FROM H.M.S. "HERALD,” The ceremonial on His Highness the Rajah’s birthday was distinguished this year by the presence of a Naval Guard of Honour from H.M.S. Herald. which arrived at Tending on September 25th. This guard, which was commanded by' Lieut. R. H. Connell, R.N., consisted of sixteen men and a Petty Officer. The naval detachment fell in with the Constabulary guard in front of the Borneo Company 's offices at 8.15 a.m.. and marched to Pengkalan Batu, where it took up position on the right. At 9 a.m. a Royal Salute of twenty-one guns was fired from Fort Margherita battery. On the con clusion of the salute His Highness the Tuan Muda, accompanied by Mr. N. E. Hughes, A.D.C., left Astana steps and proceeded across river to Peng kalan Batu. His Highness was met on landing by Mr. H. B. Crocker. Acting Government Secretary. Mr. D. V. Murphy, Acting Commissioner of Sarawak Constabulary, Commander N. A. C. Hardy, R.N., (the Captain of H.M.S. Herald), and the Datu Shahbandar. After taking the salute. His Highness met Mr. W. II. Kelley, who was in command of the Con stabulary guard, and Lieut. Connell, and inspected the two guards of honour, commencing with the Naval guard. His Highness then walked to the Court house, which had been socially decorated for the occasion, and proceeded to the dais, where Dayang Anne, Mr. A. W. D. Brooke, and European and Asiatic members of the Council Negri and Committee, of Administration and others were waiting. The remainder of the guests to the number of about 160 were accommodated in the body of the Court house. When all the medals and long service decorations had been bestowed by His Highness, refreshments were served, and the Government Secretary made a short speech in the course of which he mentioned how glad we all were to see the officers and men of H.M.S. Herald in Kuching, and thanked the Captain of the Herald for his very courteous gesture in furnishing a naval guard to do honour to the occasion. He then proposed the health of His Highness the Rajah, which was drunk by all present. His Highness the Tuan Muda then returned to Astana. I'he following telegram was despatched to His Highness the Rajah by the Government Secretary on the morning of September 26th :— All officers and all communities wish Your Highness many happy returns of the day.” His Highness the Tuan Muda has addressed the following letter to the Captain of H.M.S. Herald on September 30th :— “Dear Captain Hardy, As the Rajah is absent from Sarawak it devolves on me to thank you on his behalf for your courtesy in furnishing a guard of honour from the 'Herald' to assist in the celebration of his sixty-second birthday. 1 should be grateful if you would be so good as to inform the Officer-in-Charge of the guard, and the petty officers and men composing it, how much we appreciate this contribution by the Herald to the gathering, and the additional support which was lent to the occasion by the smartness and steadiness on parade of those concerned. We feel, moreover, that, this gesture on your part is (if I may say so) a particularly happy one in view of the Herald's long association with Sarawak, and the cordial relations which have always existed between her Officers and personnel and those of this Government. Believe me, Yours very sincerely, (Signed) BERTRAM BROOKE. Tuan Muda." No account of the proceedings on His Highness the Rajah's birthday would be complete without some tribute to the smartness and steadiness of both the Naval and Constabulary guards of honour. This was remarked on by all the spectators, and reflects great credit on the officers and men concerned. Our thanks are also due to the Datu Amar, who was responsible for the very successful decoration of the Court house and its approaches A Note On Food. Owing to considerations of space the third instal¬ ment of this article is held over, and will appear next month. —EDITOR. The late Mr. F. A. W. Page Turner. A correspondent writes as follows :— “I was very glad to see that in your obituary notice of the late Mr. F. A. W. Page-Turner you referred to the occasion on which, unarmed and helpless, he dispersed an enemy advance guard with a few caustic words and a shower of pebbles. There is, however, another achievement of 'P—T's’ which is not so well-known, but which should, I think, be recorded, since it is an excellent example of his personal courage and influence with Dayaks. “When Page-Turner took over the Second Division no European had ever been beyond the Government station at Lubok Antu. (up the Ulu Ai, that is,) except when on expeditions. Lubok Antu itself was a stockaded post, and all the long- houses in the Ulu were on the tops of hills, instead of on the river hanks. This circumstance in itself will show the state of affairs that prevailed in the Ulu, where the writ of Government did not run, where all was suspicion and distrust, and where conditions of anarchy and disorder prevailed. "Page-Turner, however, determined to put an end to all this. Against all advice he set off up river with one Native Officer the late Dato Haji Bua Assan, I think,) and only one policeman; he had decided that a proper guard would only bo provocative, and he relied on his personal prestige to see him through. “And he was right He spent several weeks in the Ulu arguing, cajoling and commanding, without any backing other than the force of his own will, and returned in due course to Lubok Antu safe and sound. Within one month of his return the whole Ulu Ai had acknowledged the Rajah’s sovereignly, and every long-house had moved down from the hill-tops to the banks of the river. Anarchy and the misrule of the tribal chiefs had been replaced by sound administration, and the prevailing distrust had yielded to peace and confidence which continued until his retire¬ ment. Not a bad achievement, surely.” Verily, there were giants in those days. Notice. MEMORIAL TO THE LATE REV. FATHER VINCENT HALDER. It is proposed that some token of esteem be erected to the memory of the late Rev. Father Halder by his many European friends. Will those who have come in personal contact with 'Apai' subscribe to a token of remembrance in the form of a tombstone suitably inscribed? Subscriptions will be received by Mr. P. Cobbold, Sibu Those wishing to subscribe should send their subscriptions before 1st December, 1936. Sibu, 4th September, 1936. Kematian Almarhum Haji Mohammad Rais Dato Eman Tua. Dengan beberapa duka chita kita memberitakan ia-itu Haji Mohammad Rais Dato’ Emam Tua telah kembali ka-Rahmatullah pada hari Khamis ‘24 September, 1936 pukol 3 petang dan di-kebumikan pada hari Jum'at pukol 2 lepas Sembahayang Jum’at.

Kuching Rotary Club. At the lunch Meeting of the Kuching Rotary Club held at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, 23rd September, 1936, reference was made by the President, Mr. H. M. Calvert, to the death of the 80th District Governor, H.R.H. Prince Purachatra, which occurred at the General Hospital, Singapore, on 14th September. The sad news was immediately communicated by telegram by the Rotary Club of Singapore to all other Clubs in the 80th District and caused much grief amongst Rotarians. Kuching Rotary Club experienced a special sense of regret in view of the fact that the late Prince was to come over here at the end of the month to present the Rotary Charter to the local Club. The body is now lying-in-state at the residence of the late highly-esteemed Rotarian- Governor pending the completion of arrangements to take the coffin to Bangkok for burial towards the end of this month. A message of condolence has been conveyed to the family by the Kuching Rotary Chib and a wreath has been ordered for the ceremonial send-off. The late Prince was a brother of King Prajadhipok and the uncle of the present “boy” King of Siam and though his activities were mostly connected with his own country, he was very well-known in Malaya during later years, after his retirement from the Siamese Government service, when he settled down in Singapore. He was a very keen and enthusiastic Rotarian, being the first President of the Bangkok Rotary Club. His popularity was evidenced by his appointment as the 80th District Governor in 1934-1935 and he was again appointed this year. During his governorship and due to his energy, two new Clubs came into existence, one in Taiping, F.M.S., and the other in Kuching, Sarawak, and when he first came over here for the inauguration of the latter Club, he made a host of friends by his genial disposition and breezy personality. The late Prince was born on 23rd January, 1882, and received his early education in England, studying at Harrow and Trinity College, Cam¬ bridge. which course of study in later years stood him in good stead for his work and patriotism for his own country. He first served in the Army where his promotion was rapid until he became Inspector-General of the Land Forces, which he brought up to a high pitch of efficiency as is evidenced at the present time. Later he was seconded to the Ministry as the Minister of Rail¬ ways, during which time he was greatly instru¬ mental in extending and improving the Railways and communications of his country. Lastly during his office as Minister of Commerce and Commu¬ nications he did a lot to develop the principal exports of Siam which are mainly rice and teak¬ wood. Finally, before retiring he held the office of Supreme Councillor of State for one year. He had many interests, and in business was connected with various companies operating in Malaya and Siam. He was a much-travelled man, having been to the Continent of Europe and America more than once, both on pleasure and in connection with his Rotary Governorship. On his last world tour ho attended the International Rotary Convention in Mexico. He was an outstanding linguist, speaking fluently a number of languages besides his own. He was also an enthusiastic photographer and was never far or for long parted from his cine camera, especially when on holiday or travelling, to the ultimate delight of his many friends who were privileged to see his films. Keenly interested in all he did, lie will be greatly missed by all with whom he was associated in his many interests. Of his social activities Rotary perhaps lay nearest his heart, and he gave unstintingly of his best in serving the movement which he firmly believed would be of lasting benefit to his fellow-men. To those who knew him personally, his loss will be great and the service he so willingly gave will be long remembered and will not be easily replaced. Contributed. Farewell Visit of Air Commodore S. W. Smith, R.A.F. RECEPTION AT ASTANA. Air Commodore S. W. Smith, o.b.e., R.A.F., arrived at Pending by flying boat at 12.25 p.m. on September 30th on the last stage of a flight from Seletar to Hong Kong and back. The purpose of this flight was to enable Air Commodore Smith to carry out his annual inspection at the Royal Air Force Station, Tai Tak, Hong Kong, and in the course of it he called at Kam Ranh Bay (French Indo China), Manila, and Kudat. It is understood that the flight was entirely without incident and was carried out to schedule. Since this was Air Commodore Smith's last visit to Sarawak before relinquishing his command of the Royal Air Force, Far East, in order to take up another appointment, he was received on arrival with a salute of eleven guns and a Constabulary guard of honour. Air Commodore Smith and the other R.A.F. officers who accompanied him (Group Captain A. H. Peck, D.S.O., M.C., and Squadron Leader C. S. Riccard) were met at Pending by H.H.M.Y. Maimuna, which convoyed them to Astana, where an official landing took place. The official landing was followed by a reception at which members of the Council Negri and Supreme Council and certain other officers- were present. Refreshments were handed round, and His Highness the Tuan Muda welcomed Air Com¬ modore Smith in a short speech in which he referred to the very cordial relations that had always prevailed between the Royal Air Force and Sarawak, and which were due in no small measure to* the invariable courtesy, sympathy and help¬ fulness of Air Commodore Smith himself. He expressed the sorrow that was felt by all in Sarawak at the thought that this was the last time that we should see Air Commodore Smith on Sarawak soil, and added that the good wishes of his many friends in this country would go with him to whatever new post he was called upon to fill. The same was true of the various other R.A.F. officers who had frequently visited Sarawak, and who would shortly be returning to England. His Highness then proposed the health of the Air Commodore, which was drunk by all present. Air Commodore Smith replied in a few words thanking His Highness the Tuan Muda for his speech and saying how sorry lie was to be leaving Sarawak, a country of which he and his officers would always have the happiest recollections; he added that he hoped that he would be able to meet some of his Sarawak friends in England in due course, and then concluded with the toast of ‘His Highness the Tuan Muda.' This toast was drunk by all the guests, who then dispersed. Air Commodore Smith left for Singapore at 8 a.m. on October 2nd and reached Singapore four hours later. The following telegrams were exchanged between the Air Commodore, and His Highness the Tuan Muda :— From Air Commodore Smith to His Highness the Tuan Muda :— “I leave Sarawak with very happy memories mindful always of the many kindnesses I have received from you and your officers. My best wishes to you, and to Anne, and am looking forward to our meeting in England.” From His Highness the Tuan Muda and Dayang Anne to Air Commodore Smith:— “Many thanks for your message. Although we shall miss your visits here we all of us in Sarawak shall follow your career with affectionate interest and look forward to meeting you again individually elsewhere. Please convey our heartiest messages of good¬ will to your officers and our friends whose departure is also imminent. May you and Mrs. Sidney Smith and Maureen and your officers have safe passages home and enjoy the best of good fortune in the future.” The Fast Motor Road Myth. The decision to devote £400,000 to the. “modernisa¬ tion” of the Kingston by-pass, which was first opened in 19'27, has not apparently convinced people of the futility of fast roads as a remedy for the loss of life through motor accidents. If it were not sufficient evidence that the Kingston by-pass is, apart from the Great West Hoad (also specially built for fast traffic) the scene of the greatest number of deaths and mannings, we have the case of Germany before us. Germany has been laying out a network of fast double-track motor roads as rapidly as the energy of her dictator can make them. And Germany has a casualty list on the roads every bit as high as our own, although she has only half the number of motor cars distributed over twice the area. However unpalatable the truth may be to the motorist, the only way to decrease loss of life is by travelling more slowly, and any incentive to speed, whether by fast roads or otherwise, is bound in the long run to have the opposite effect. —Truth. Memories of Singapore 20 Years ago. CHINESE RETURNS ROM SARAWAK. A Singapore without motor-cars. Horse drawn hackney carriages plodding down the narrow streets of the town. Going to market in a sampan. Mr. Ong Tiang Swee, proprietor of the Batu Kinyang Farm, Sarawak, and a director of the Sarawak Steamship Co., Ltd., who is now in Singapore for the first time in 20 years, is amazed at the remarkable changes that have taken place in this city since he left it shortly after getting married. He well remembers seeing horse carriages in the streets and reminiscently recalls that 20 years ago the only way of reaching the Beach Road market from Tanjong Rhu was by way of the sea in a sampan. As be lounges in the spacious hall of the new bungalow in Tanjong Rhu, built by his son-in-law, Mr. Wee Kheng Chiang, chairman of the United Chinese Bank, Singapore, Mr. Ong marvels at the change time Las wrought in Singapore. TO-DAY’S "SILENT CHARIOT.” The Singapore of 1936 is far different from that of 1916. The old familiar spots have given way to new buildings, schools, parks and roads, and where the horse drawn carriage used to go klop-klopping down the street, the silent chariot of to-day, the motor-car, has taken its place. Mr. Ong has the distinction of being the first Chinese in Sarawak to be made a Companion of the Star of Sarawak, a high recognition of the Government for services rendered. Born in Sarawak, he first came to Singapore when 18 years of age. Tie spent two years in a local school, went back to Sarawak and only returned the following year to marry a Singapore girl. He was unfortunate to lose his wife and arrived in Singapore again two years later to marry a second time. HEAD OF COMMUNITY. In Sarawak Mr. Ong is the recognized head of the Chinese community. He was the first chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Sarawak and also the first chairman of its Hokkien Kongsi. He has also occupied a position on the Board of the Farm Syndicate and was a member of the Committee of Administration in Sarawak. From 1911—1920 he was president of a magisterial court for dealing with Chinese cases—a position which was entirely honorary. Mr. Ong is in Singapore purely "for pleasure” and to see a few of his relations. He has nearly fifty children, grand-children and great grand¬ children, most of whom are in Sarawak. —Sunday Times. Shingles. Many of us recall our astonishment on discovering that our attractively weathered roofs were not covered with slates, as we had thought, but with belian shingles—or, as we usually prefer to call them, ''ataps.” And it is perhaps not generally recognised that this form of roof-covering is by no means con¬ fined to this country, a fact that should have some commercial value. Shingles have been used from the earliest histori¬ cal times both for roof and wall-covering, and, of course, were first used in this country by the aboriginal peoples. The early settlers of Canada and the United States may be regarded as the modern pioneers of shingled roofs on a large scale but they have been used in many countries of the Old World and are now beginning to get recogni¬ tion in the United Kingdom principally as a result of the initiative of the British Columbian manu¬ facturers of cedar shingles. People in the Malay Peninsula have in the past fought shy of wooden ataps, perhaps both on account of prejudice and the high cost of imported teak shingles but, there also, efforts are now being made to popularise locally made shingles of impregnated mengeris. The mengeris shingles, unlike our belian atap, are tapered, following the custom adopted in America and elsewhere. The taper is given in the interest of stability, the greater thickness at the base assist¬ ing to prevent warping, but experience has shown that our own form which is of uniform thickness throughout is perfectly satisfactory and lies flat under the most exacting conditions. The original standard shingle in this country was split by hand to dimensions of 18" x 3 1/2" x 1/5" to 1/2" and long held the Geld against any attempt to in¬ troduce the sawn variety. This was due principally to the fear that sawn shingles, possibly cut across the grain of the wood, would be more liable to warp or split, but in the last few years there has been an increasing demand for the latter and this demand must be accepted as evidence that the sawn variety is at least as satisfactory as the other since there is no price advantage. The sawn shingle has, of course, one great advantage at the outset, namely its uniformity of thickness, but this could not offset the very great drawback of any tendency to warp. Fortunately there is no such tendency. A note of warning must, however, be sounded here. There is more danger of sapwood being included in the sawn variety end the attention of producers should be given to careful grading as the sapwood of belian is notoriously liable to infestation by beetles (bubok). There has always been a certain amount of com¬ petition from other forms of roofing, particularly tiles and also asbestos-cement or other sheets, but for domestic roofing and many types of public buildings the shingle has remained unchallenged, and it needs no propaganda in this country. But the question arises as to whether greater advantage cannot be taken of the undoubted qualities of belian ataps by an extension of the trade outside our own borders, and it is suggested that the new interest shown in shingles in Malaya and also their increasing use in South Africa might warrant investigation by the producers of the possibilities of these markets. With the price of belian ataps as high as $100 per laksa it has been stated that the cost of covering 100 square feet would be roughly $7 as compared with $20 for Indian tiles and $25 for asbestos corrugated sheets, and it would therefore seem that, with the added advantage of light weight and good insulating properties (as compared with tiles), pleasing appearance (as compared with asbestos) and undoubted durability, the shingle is in a strong com¬ petitive position. —T.C, Some notes on the breeding of the Edible Turtle (Chelone mydas) in Sarawak. BY E. BANKS, CURATOR, SARAWAK MUSEUM. The Islands of Talang Talang off the coast of Sarawak doubtless served as a resort for pirates in early times, but with the arrival of a more peaceful regime an enterprising Malay acquired them for the sake of the eggs laid there by the many turtles visiting the islands for that purpose. The islands came into prominence in about 1875, when one of this Malay's sons threatened to shoot the Governor of British North Borneo, then on a visit, as a result of which his right to the collection of turtle eggs was taken away by the Rajah of Sarawak and allotted among the leading Malay Datus or Chiefs, an arrangement which persists at His Highness the Rajah’s pleasure to this day. The islands are quite small, situated from five to six miles from the mainland ; Talang Talang Besar and Talang Talang Kechil lie off the mouth of the Simatan River, between Lundu and Cape Datu, Satang Besar lying off the Santubong entrance to the Kuching River. The actual sandy beaches where the turtles lay comprise only a fraction of the islands, and their small size is even more remarkable considering the number of turtles which use them. I am indebted to the present holders of the turtle egg rights of the islands, namely the Datu Shah¬ bandar, the Datu Imam, the Datu Mentri, and to the Secretary’ for Native Affairs, Mr. F. II. Pollard, for access to the very complete accounts kept for several years recording the number of turtles and the eggs they lay nightly on the three islands. I have also been able to visit the islands and examine the turtles, and no account would be complete without mention of the whole-hearted assistance rendered by Bujang Nawi, the Malay keeper living on Talang Talang Besar. With the exception of one or two visits yearly from the Hawkflbill Turtle (Chelone imbricata), valued for its tortoise-shell, the only species to visit the islands is the Green or Edible Turtle (chelone mydas), and it is an eerie sight on a moonlight night at high tide to see scores of these four-hundred- pound monsters emerge from the sea, black and shiny like so many enormous leeches or slugs, and struggle slowly up the beach before depositing their eggs in the sand above high-water mark. The laying of the Green Turtle has often been described and may only briefly be referred to here. On calm nights as early as 8 p.m. and as late as 4 a.m. the female turtles approach the shore and crawl out of the surf onto the sand, at this stage being easily frightened back into the water by strange noises. Raising her head, she gives four or five jerks forwards, gripping the sand with fore and hind flippers and moving from two to three yards in all. after which the head is lowered, the animal heaves a sort of tired sigh and takes a rest for a minute or two before repeating the perfor¬ mance, for the weight of its shell or carapace makes breathing on land so difficult that if captured alive they die of suffocation if not turned over on their hacks. It is necessary for the animals to lay above the high-tide line, waler instantly killing the eggs, some beasts laving as far inland as there is sand, others being content with just a few yards above high-water mark. These breeding turtles arc all the same size to within a few inches, the carapace or shell measuring from 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet in length and young or old could not be distinguished by size alone. Having reached a suitable spot the sand is scooped out of a broad shallow hollow about six feet wide and two to three feet in depth, the fore and hind flippers scattering the sand in jets right and left and behind ; after this, a vertical shaft is dug down about eighteen inches, the hind feet working alternately as scoops, the soles turning up at the outside edges to retain the scooped-up sand, which is thrown away back-handedly. The turtle then puts its tail down the hole; the eggs arc laid usually two at a time in a few minutes, the hole is covered up With sand by the hind feet, and sand is finally scattered about in all directions to conceal the nest, which by this time has been carefully marked with a flag by the collector, who removes the contents at daylight when the turtle has gone. Her departure seawards after laying is just as laborious as her arrival some three or four hours before, and it is often daylight before some of them reach the sea. The comparison between their pro- gress on land and their quick—and doubtless very thankful—Escape into deep waler is very marked. On reselling the sea, the turtle is eagerly awaited by a maie and mating may be observed taking place on the surfs e during the daytime, the only occasion when for once in a way the creatures are unwary. Just whether each female turtle has her own mate or whether one male serves many is not yet clear, nor is the gestation period really known; both by purposely marking with paint and by noting such peculiarities as the loss of a flipper to a shark or some peculiar barnacles on its shell, the people on the islands have shown that the same turtle comes up at least three times in the course of the year, at about fourteen-day intervals. There no doubt about this and it has been recorded else- where, but so far no record has been made of the same animal returning to the same place year after year, the point marks on the females’ carapace being apparently rubbed off by the male in mating. Malavs eat the eggs but not turtle meat, and the animals have been strictly preserved, a heavy penalty being inflicted for killing one; in Ceylon, Seychelles and elsewhere the eggs are left to hatch and a proportion of the adults killed off for the sake of their meat, a more profitable proceeding to which I shall refer later. Of the Loggerhead Turtle (caretta caretta), whose eggs are of value but not its meat. I have only beard once in Sarawak, but I have seen none on the islands nor do the people , there recognize i from photographs or descriptions; it differs from the Green Turtle in having an eagle- likc “tooth” to its beak, five or six costals and twenty-seven marginal scales instead of four and twenty-five, and two claws instead of one on the fore flipper. Though turtles lay all the year round, the season is at its height from about May to September, the beginning and ending being doubtless somewhat dependent on the weather. In good years Talang Talang Besar produces over 400,000 eggs in August and again in September, and in normal years from 200—300.000 eggs, dropping to 20 to 10.000 eggs in the winter months. Apart from the presence of a fairly definite breeding season, the monthly and annual figures are remarkable for indicating good and bad breeding vears as a whole, and it is of interest here to examine the possible causes. The Kuching-Lundu district is subject to a fine, dry period from about April to October, and a very wet and stormy period (known as the landas) varying in intensity, from November to March. Our only means of gauging the continued severity or otherwise of this landas or wet monsoon is from the rainfall in Kuching and Lundu, situated some eight to ten miles in a direct line from the sea. The following figures therefore show the Kuching Annual Rainfall and the total annual collection of turtle eggs, when it will be seen fairly clearly that a wet year—indicating a rough and stormy landas from November to March —is followed by a poor breeding season on the islands from May to September, and vice versa, a dry year with a mild landas meaning a heavy breeding season. The average annual rainfall in Kuching is about 160 inches, corresponding to a collection of about 2 1/4 million turtle eggs the following year; a very dry year with a mild landas such as 1933-34 entailed a big laying season in 1934, totalling over three million eggs, whilst a wet year and a rough landas such as in 1934-35, meant a very poor year in 1935, with barely a million eggs collected. Just what effect a rough landas has on turtles it is not easy to say; it may scatter them far and wide, drive them away from their feeding grounds, for they are vegetarians, feeding on a kind of sea grass; or it may prevent mating, which takes place on the surface, although as the gestation period is not known and mating certainly takes place after laying it cannot yet be said for certain that this is one of the causes. The rough seas further dis¬ perse far and wide the sands on the beaches, which are certainly not as suitable for laying in the year following. On Talang Talang Besar and Kechil turtles average from 105—110 eggs at a "sitting" rather more on Satang (110—120). either because the island is less crowded and disturbed or because the collectors make a cleaner sweep. The record lay¬ ings certainly go to Satang, one turtle having deposited 176 and another 162 on May 10th and 18th. 1933, respectively. The record nightly totals of course go to Talang Talang Besar, where during 1934. 180 turtles on August 1st laid 18.283 eggs and on August 2nd 183 laid 19.037 eggs. Talang Talang Besar contributes from 52 - 56% of the annual total. Talang Talang Kechil 38 - 40% and Satang 7 8% with remarkable regularity. The night is divided into three four-hour watches by the collectors, who keep a count of the turtles coming up in their watch, the 10 p.m.—2 am. period being the most crowded time as the turtles do not come up much before dusk, and have mostly finished laying before daylight. No account of the turtles would be complete without considering their commercial aspects. At present the eggs are gathered nightly, dried in the sun. packed in wooden boxes containing approxi¬ mately eight hundred apiece, and shipped to Kuching ns often as once a week in the fine weather. When new-laid they are not quite com¬ pletely full but rapidly lose moisture on being stored, those in the bottom of the box often going bad or arriving so deflated that they fetch but little price. The fortunes of the turtle eggs after collection are outlined roughly below. Turtle eggs are consumed or given away by the holders of the collection rights or else sold in Kuching or exported to Singapore, and the total value above is a potential one taken from the export price, no allowance being made for those that go bad or are eaten by the owners. The export trade in late years has been comparatively small, the local consumption and sale high; from 1928 and 1932-35 this varied only from 88 - 98%, whilst the price ranged from 45 cents to $1.09 per hundred and the total number of eggs from one to three millions. In these years at any rate the export has borne no relation to price and quantity, though for some reason in 1927 the export was much greater, though price and quantity were as in 1928 and quantity as in 1932. It is possible to obtain from Customs reports the quantities exported for other years and the price, but on the whole it does not seem likely that the 8%—the average of the total exported during 1928 and 1932-1935—holds good for other years; in fact there is some evidence that the export has been on the decline except for . sporadic years. It is of some interest to note that 1917 and 1919 were very poor years for export and probably totals, judging by those for 1933 and 1935, though it is only a comparison. The rainfall for 1917 was 218 \and for 1918 185, both very high, January, February and March 1917 in Kuching totalling 54. 30 and 20 inches respectively, indicating a bad landas though the 1918-19 landas does not appear to , have been unduly heavy. It does, however, hear out the assumption that the bad weather in the early part of 1917 meant a poor laying season that year just as the bad landas for the 1934-35 season did for 1935. In 1905 and 1906. which were two of the driest years ever recorded in Kuching, an average of a million eggs were exported annually, which may indicate that a mild landas meant a still finer laying season, though as we have a seen, it is not always safe to assume for certain that a large export meant a large total collection of eggs. As 1 have said, many eggs go bad in transit or rrive in the town in poor condition for sale, and the use of a preservative such as water-glass is being tried to keep them in better shape. Turtle eggs appearing in outstations are often eagerly purchased, and it may be possible to preserve, grade and export the eggs to these places rather than Singapore. With regard to the question of turtle meat, in other countries the eggs are left to hatch and the adults taken, but there seems little prospect of such au arrangement happening here. As a rule no eggs whatever are left to hatch, though a month’s truce has occasionally been declared on one island : the Malays do demand the eggs and may not eat the meat, so the present arrangement is likely to continue. The potential value of the eggs works out at from $7-23,000 per annum ; the cost of collecting, etc., is estimated at about $6,200 per annum, which does not always leave a great profit when the eggs consumed and gone bad are taken into account. Seeing that from 13-30.000 turtle layings take place annually, which means a minimum of 4-10.000 turtles if they all lay three times a year, it is not unlikely that some of these could be spared for the sake of the meat in favour of allowing the eggs to hatch. The Malays, however, scarcely consider it any¬ thing better than a waste of time to try and let the eggs hatch out. many going rotten during the 50 days' incubation and the young turtles heading straight down to the sea where, as it is some time before they can swim and dive adequately, they form a most, easy prey to small sharks and other predatory fishes,—in fact it has been estimated that only 2—3% survive to grow up. In the circum¬ stances it is astonishing that the stock maintains itself, for though the growth rate has not been accurately determined, the young turtle has a carapace length of about an inch and a half at birth, and judging by the growth rate of the Loggerhead, whose young are a similar size. at birth and whose adults measure much the same, the young turtles have only just doubled their size in six months. A captive Green Turtle at the age of 28 months had a carapace length of 18 inches which gives him about seven years, even then probably an under¬ estimate, before be arrives at the adult size of four feet carapace length. Nowadays turtle meat is only fetching 10-20 cents per kati in Singapore, and there is little likelihood of any local consumption or export trade at this price. Eggs preserved in water- lass mixed with wafer 1 : 30-40 have so far proved satisfactory, but further enquiry is needed. The Honorary Secretary will welcome from Members suggestions made direct in writing or through the Suggestion Book for the purchase of suitable Library Books and will curry out such suggestions as far as funds permit. E. BANKS, Curator, Museum & Library. First Division News. AUGUST. Mr. W. F. Dick, Resident, First Division, reports s follows :— I took over the affairs of the Division from Mr. F. H Pollard on the 5th; the following day proceeded to Serian with Mr. E. H. Elam, District Officer, and Mr. T. A. Reid, Assistant Engineer, Public Works Department. 1 was surprised to notice that practically every pepper garden on the roadside was well cared for, and there were many young gardens which must have been plained within the last six months. The only abandones garden was one which I was informed was 18 years old. I was also interested to see plantations of kapok, bananas, coffee and krebang all flourishing along the roadside. ’ The bazaar at the 32nd mile consisting of three shops appeared to be flourishing, and two more shops were in course of being erected; these and the shops at Serian are all of the new. standard type and are a great improvement on the usual bazaar shophouse. "The new Serian bazaar consists of ten new shops and preparation is being made for the erection of another four. The low ground at the, back of the new shops is in urgent need of being filled before the landas, as otherwise there would be a risk of landslides during the wet season and possible damage to the new shops. A special vote to cover the cost of this work is being applied for. The appearance of the. station has changed considerably since I last saw it twelve months ago; the site of the old leaf-attap bazaar has been cleared and the level raised in readiness for the new Police barracks which are to be erected there. The old jail from Gedong has been re-erected, and. although somewhat small, is a substantial belian building. The Court and Office, which was the old Sadong Mine office, appears to be very satisfactory and part of the first floor makes a very good dispensary. I left al 6.30) a.m. on the 13th on a visit to . Bau and met Mr. L. K. Morse, the Acting District Officer, at Siniawan, where I examined the site of a proposed cinema hall. The erosion of the river bank at the back of the bazaar is serious, and at least one building is in imminent danger of collapse. From Siniawan we proceeded to Baku and discussed the question of rebuilding the bazaar which was burnt down last year. The old bazaar conristed of leaf attap shacks and had outlived its usefulness; it is doubtful whether any of the old shopkeepers would be prepared to put up decent shophouses and it was decided not to plan a layout for a new bazaar, but that one or two shops might be built to the approved standard design. From there we proceeded to Bau where various matters were discussed : the rebuilding of the barracks is very necessary and an extension to the market should be put in hand as soon as possible. “On the 18th 1 proceeded to Lundu with Mr. G. F. J. Pegler, the Acting District Officer, by m.l. Lucile, arriving at 3.30 p.m. The station appeared to be well kept. In the afternoon visited the Malay school at Stunggang which has been built by the local Malays as the old school belonging to Abang Haji Dewa was too small to house all the boys. “The next morning on September 20th we left at 5.15 a.m. for Telok Serabang, where we picked up the Tua Kampong, and then went on to Telok Gadong where Japanese fishing boats arc known to go ashore ; the water is very deep here. We anchored in 37 feet of water about 200 yards from the shore; there were signs on shore of the Japanese having recently been there tanning their nets. Wo left again at 10.30 a.m. and returned to Lundu, arriving at 3.45 p.m. The following day. Friday 21st. we left at 9.15 a.m. and arrived in Kuching at 3.30 p.m. "Applications for coconut land on the Coast are on the increase; the embargo on rubber planting is probably partly responsible, but the success of other coconut gardens on the Coast which have been under the supervision of the Senior Agricul¬ tural Officer is probably the main reason for this demand. “The question of properly laid out bazaars at small villages has been under consideration lately, and it appears that traders generally are keen on putting up proper bazaars but find themselves unable to compete with the ordinary boat hawker who has no expenses, and who often gets food from his customers for nothing. It is obviously far better to encourage the shops and discourage the boat hawker; this could be done by restricting the number of boat hawkers licences, or increasing the licence fee “ Five inquests were held in Kuching during the month. On August 10th a verdict of suicide during temporary insanity was returned at the inquiry held into the death of Chiam Choon Boo, a Hylam Chinese, who threw himself into the river from the wharf of the Borneo Company, Limited. At an inquiry into the death of No. 579 Constable Lihi bin Omar, who died suddenly after no apparent illness on August 6th, 19.36. a verdict of death from natural causes was recorded. A similar verdict was returned on August 11th at an inquiry held into the death of a Cantonese named Yip Ah Kiew. This man was found lying in Ewe Hai Street, and it being apparent that he was seriously ill. the ambulance was summoned. Before reaching the hospital, however, the man died. Another verdict of death from natural causes was recorded on August 26th at an inquiry into the death of Bujang bin Abang Mat Nor, of Central Road, Kuching, whose death was due to ulceration of the stomach. A mysterious tire broke out on August 12th in a room at No. 50, Carpenter Street, Kuching. The door of the room was locked and had to be forced open by the Police; on entering they found the slightly charred body of a man lying upon a bed which was still smouldering. The bed and surround¬ ings smelt strongly of kerosene oil. At the inquest heard on August 26th. it was revealed that when forced open, the door was locked on the inside. An open verdict was returned, there being insufficient evidence to support a theory that deceased had committed suicide. On August 12th. Georgina Mong, aged 3 years, (he daughter of a dresser in the Medical Department, was knocked down and killed by a Public Works Department lorry. At the inquest a verdict of accidental death was recorded. The driver of the lorry was exonerated from all blame. verdict of accidental death by drowning was recorded on August 31st at the inquiry into the death of Sebul bin Ibut of Sejijak. whose boat capsized off Sejijak during a storm. The District Officer, Kuching, records with regret the death, which occurred on July 10th, of Haji Salleh bin Mat, Tua Kampong of Boyan. Haji Salleh had completed seven years in Government Service. Setar. Tua Kampong of Merdang Lumut, was forced to resign his appointment on August 22nd on account of ill-health. Gending. Tua Kampong of Merdang Gayam, was instructed to take over the affairs of Merdang Lumut. Accompanied by the Datu Amar, the District Officer, Kuching, proceeded to Setakan on August 12th. This village had not been visited by an Administrative Officer for more than ten years. On August 28th the District Officer, accom¬ panied by the Datu Amar, visited the villages at Batu Kitang and Lubok Buya. It is of interest to report that the village at Lubok Buya is kept in extraordinarily clean condition, the natives taking great pride in its general appearance. Mr. Oh Teow Teng, Court Interpreter, Kuching, resigned his appointment with effect from August 14th. Mr. Lim Kim Han. Chief Cashier in the Resident's Office. Kuching, resigned his appoint¬ ment on August 11th. This officer had completed more than 30 years' service. In his report for August the District Officer, Kuching, mentions that through the enterprise of Abang Sumali, the son of Datu Haji Suhaili, a somewhat unique method of fishing on a large scale is being attempted between Tanjong Sepang and Bulan Lakei. The method, winch is known as panau, is as follows :— A float (6 inches by 4 inches) is made and to this is attached a line the length of which varies according to the depth of water to be worked. A heavy stone is fastened to the other end of the line in order to keep it vertical below the surface, and some 24 feet below the float a large nipah frond is secured so that it is at right angles to the line. This frond offers a certain amount of shade, and fish collect in large numbers under it. The trap having been set in this manner, nine men approach in a boat with ropes and a large conical net known as idus. The net is 24 feet in diameter, and 42 feet in length. When close to the float one man slips overboard with a length of rope, one end of which is secured in the boat, and dives to a point on the vertical rope of the trap about 30 feet, below the nipah frond. From this point he contrives to disturb the fish which move gently upwards to the frond. He repeats the process, getting a little nearer the frond each time, and as he approaches, the fish move out towards the unsecured end of the frond and in the direction of the position taken up by the boat. When he considers that the fish are in the desired position die diver tugs at the rope thus signalling the other men to dive in and approach the fish from below with the conical net, which is held open by being tied to each man’s wrists from points at regular intervals round its circumference. Almost all the fish which have collected are taken in the net as it is brought gradually to the surface. It is a sur¬ prising fact that throughout the process the fish shew no apparent desire to get away. The general principle adopted by a community employing this method is to cover an area with such traps at intervals of about 200 in depths increasing from 10 to 20 fathoms. Abang Sumali has enlisted the aid of seventeen Melanau fishermen from Bintulu, whence this type of fishing is said to have originated. Rumours of the efficacy of this method have reached fishermen of Bako, Buntal. Kuala Tebas and Santubong, and considerable interest is being displayed. It is alleged that certain Chinese fishermen, regarding jealously the largo quantities of fish secured by this means, make a practice of severing the lines of the traps. Catches of six pikuls weight have been made at a single trap. Nine civil and sixteen criminal eases came before the Bau Courts during the month. Of the latter, the most important were His High¬ ness the Rajah vs. Chin Chui Jin, who was sentenced to one year’s rigorous imprsionment under section 825, and His Highness the Rajah Liew Chaw, who was sentenced to a similar sentence under section 411. On August 4th one Yong Fah was brought to Tondong Police Station badly cut about the head. He was not expected to live, but made a wonderful recovery. His. assailant was arrested some days later and was duly convicted under section 325 as mentioned above. He was exceedingly lucky not to have been tried on a more serious charge. 392 persons were treated at Bau Government Dispensary during August and 80 N.A.B. injections were given. The District Officer, Bau, reports that there appears to be a definite decrease in the number of malaria cases in Bau township and the mines. Three men were treated for arsenical poisoning at Kim Lee mine; it is believed that they were smelting arsenical ore. It is understood that the men have since died in Kuching Hospital. The District Officer, Bau, records with regret the death of Orang Kaya Busu of Suba, Buan, who fell from a fruit tree and broke his back. It is believed that he was one of the oldest Orang Kaya in Upper Sarawak. Dahan Rubber Estates harvested 17,000 lbs. of dry rubber during August. The Manager, Mr. J. B. Simpson, proceeded on home leave, his place at Dahan being filled by Mr. A. R. Dee from British North Borneo. One new mining company, the “Oriental," com¬ menced leaching on August. 15th, and one of the oldest companies, the Hua Kiaw, ceased operations. Applications for Exclusive Prospecting Licence in the area bounded by Kampong Suba Buan, Opar, Serasot, Gumbang and Pengkallan Tebang have been received; where applications were approved, steps were taken to protect the native rights. One application for an area of several square miles was received, but the application was not approved. The average price of gold in July was $58.30. The total production was 1,885.621 fine ozs. Saburan mine treated fifty-eight tons of ore and obtained 71.36 line ozs. of gold; other mines treated two or three thousand tons to obtain a similar amount. The following table gives the individual output of gold from the various mines for July, 1936 :— The District Officer, Serian and Samarahan states that five cases of breach of passport regulations were dealt with in his district during the month; in all thirty Netherlands East Indies subjects were arrested for entering Sarawak territory at Balai Kerangan without passes. When arrested, all made the same excuse, namely that the price of rubber is so much higher in Sarawak than in Dutch territory that they were anxious to find work as tappers and earn some easy money. Deposits to cover survey fees have been collected from eight of the Land Dayak kampongs involved in the land disputes mentioned in last month’s report, but no further progress has been made as yet with the cases as all Dayaks have been busy burning off and planting out padi. Good bums have been experienced by nearly all, though some of the Sea Dayaks in the ulu Samarahan bad not burnt off by the end of the month. Choo Man Siong and twelve other Chinese from Samarahan applied verbally last June for land for coconuts at Tanjong Panglong, Simunjan. The Malays have been interviewed, and they wish to keep their padi land on the edge of the Sadong river which will probably mean that the Chinese will be cooped in at the back just like the Bugis are at Sungei Pendam. If these applications are approved, either the Malays must be asked to move to another place to farm or the Chinese at the time of survey must state definitely where they wish to make their drains, otherwise the same trouble may start between the Simunjan Malays and Chinese as has been going on for years between the Bugis and Malays of Kuala Sadong. Below are extracts from the report of the District Officer, Serian and Samarahan, for August :— "1 visited Simunjan from August 13th to 23rd, this long stay being necessary as 1 did not visit that station in July owing to travelling in the Ulu Sadong. I left for the Sadong Coast and Samarahan on 24th and was still away at the end of the month. In all villages where there are new demarcated bazaar areas I explained the terms and conditions of shophouse tenure to intending applications, and showed them a plan of the standard shophouse which they will be required to build if they wish to continue trading in 1937. It is hoped that by making traders erect a belian house costing about $300 they will be encouraged to settle more permanently in. their districts, and that a better class of trader will be encouraged as a settler. Traders at Pendam, Jaie ,Moyan, Nonok and Tuang will be Required to erect their houses to design within one year of application, but those at Tambirat, Sebandi and Sebangan having received five-year leases will remain in their leaf-attap shops until the expiry of their titles, and will then be required to come into line with Nonok. Semrah will be always allowed leaf-attap shops since erosion there necessitates the whole bazaar and kampong mov¬ ing every ten years. "I explained to the Malays of Serpan Moyan, Reba and Tuang about titles to padi land, and on the coast they seemed to welcome them. It was pointed out again that there is no compulsion whatsoever to take out a title, hut the Malays of Tuang, I believe, purposely misconstrued what the Native Officer and I told them. "I arrived at Muara Tuang on 29th and visited the Japanese Estate on 31st." Abang Zamhari, Native Officer, Lundu, reports that all Tua-tua Kampong, Pengarah and Orang Kaya were down during the month and that various matters regarding the administration were discussed.

Adams, Resident, Second Division, submits the following report on a recent patrol near the Dutch border :— “On August 1st I met the District Officer, Lubok Antu, at Engkilili and travelled with him to Lubok Antu, spending the night at Buloh. “August 3rd was spent at Lubok Antu, and the following day we proceeded to the Ulu Ai, reaching the block-house at N. Mujan on the fourth day. “The next day we went on foot, accompanied by members of the 'B' force and levies numbering thirty-two all told, along the tinting between Mujan and Batang Ai, spending the night near B. Graji. Later we obtained a good part of Dutch territory, and proceeded along the tinting to B. Makop, which must be about 4,000 feet high, From here we explored along the border in the Ulu Jeklan and Woh area for three days and returned to N. Mujan on the fifth day without finding any trace of rebels or farms. “The Surveyor in the Ulu Batang Ai reported that the main river had its source in B. Graji, but this must be wrong, and it must be further along the tinting beyond B. Makop. “We spent a day at N. Mujan to rest the troops and the following day attended a gawai at R. Nuli, where I met most of the far Ulu Ai chiefs and their following. “The next day we walked across to Lobang Bayar and spent the night at R. Bungkong, and the following day we attended another gawai at R. Abong where the rest of the Ulu Ai were met. “On the 18th we returned to Lubok Antu, and the following day I returned to Simanggang. "The farming prospects in the Ulu Ai are exceedingly bright, good burns having resulted from the drought. “Everyone appeared happy and friendly, and there was no reason to suppose that any of the outlaws are receiving any support, at any rate in the main river above Engkari. “On the 28th, however, a report was received from the Surveyor in Ulu Engkari that his langkau near B. Lanjok had been burgled, and rice and sail stolen. The tracks led to a langkau about four fathoms long, the existence of which was apparently unknown to the Engkari Dayaks. It can only be supposed, therefore, that some of the rebels must be lurking in this vicinity. It seems that the Surveyor had taken his wife with him, and because of this refused to allow the police to follow up the tracks; the District Officer, Lubok Antu. and Mr. F. A. Moore, who is taking over the district, were travelling in the Lemanak, so ten picked men from force ‘B’ were sent to investigate around B. Lanjok, at the same time the District Officer, Meluan, was asked to co-operate from his side.” Mr. H. E. Catfield arrived at Simanggang on August 22nd to take over the Division, and Mr. Moore to take over Lubok Antu and Engkilili. A Dayak case of incest between a man and his adopted half-sister’s granddaughter was heard at Simanggang. The man and woman, who are both about the same age, admitted that they had com¬ mitted incest, but the case was adjourned to inquire what the proper fine is. Inquiries have been made from various Penghulus and Tunis, but they do not know what the correct fine should be although they all agree that this is a case of incest. The natives in most areas of the Simanggang District have taken advantage of the dry weather to burn off their farming land. Some excellent burns have been reported. Rubber Restriction Inspectors visited the Engkilili district, Undup, Lingga and Sebuyow and Ulu, during the month. No breaches of Rubber Restric¬ tion Orders or smuggling were reported. So far there have been no applications to re plant rubber. The drought continued throughout the month at Simanggang, very little rain having fallen. All rivers have been extremely low, and the atmosphere has been very hot and hazy, chiefly owing to the burning off of the farming land. Comparatively few Dayaks visited Belong during August, and most of them were busy clearing padi farms. The District Officer, Saribas, repons that owing to a complete breakdown of the outboard motor, his travelling programme was entirely disorganized. The proposed trip to the Ulu Layer mentioned in last month’s report had to be cancelled, and it was also found impossible to visit Pusa this month. The Officer-in-Charge, Kalaka, reports that on August 29th Dayaks from R. Pengarah Nyalu reported that an old woman had died suddenly. The Dresser was sent to investigate, and reported that the deceased's body was scalded over the abdomen and back; apparently her relations had tried to bring her round by applying hot stones to her body. The Dayaks were told to try less drastic methods in future. No action was taken as the deceased was presumed to have died of heart-failure previous to the application of the hot stones. An All Dayak football competition has been started at Saratok. and so far the matches have been well attended. The standard of play is not high, but provides amusement to the spectators. Third Division News. AUGUST. The District Officer, Sibu, states that Native Officer F. Ansin returned from a tour of Penghulu Imai's district on the 31st July. He visited all Dayak houses and completed a map showing the situation of all houses and the number of doors in each house. This is in accordance with a map¬ making scheme in progress throughout this district to obtain detailed information with regard to the situation and size of all Dayak houses. Mr. Ansin also visited Penghulu Ikan's district, leaving Sibu on the 21st and returning on the 26th. The Rubber Restriction Office has now been established in the building occupied by the Public Works Department, there being insufficient room in the main Administration offices. During the month there were eight prosecutions at Sibu for planting new rubber under Order No. R—3, and twenty-six prosecutions under Order No. R—1, in connection with offences committed by rubber dealers. Rubber exports for August were exceptionally heavy, in spite of a tapping holiday during part of month which will, of course, have a greater effect on September output. Fourteen piculs of rubber sheet were confiscated and bin ned by order of the Court. The following are the Sibu trade statistics for the month : The total land revenue for the Third Division for July amounted to $9,662.93 as compared with $11,062.29 for the corresponding month of the previous year. The collection for Sibu district for the month amounted to $3,769.95 shewing a decrease of approximately $880.00 as compared with the previous month, and approximately $3,650.00 com¬ pared with the corresponding month of the previous year. Seventy-five titles for 256 acres (approximate) were issued and forwarded to various stations, being 57 payable for 224 acres, and 18 free land titles for 32 acres. Twenty titles for 136 acres (approximate) were cancelled consisting of 19 pay¬ able titles for 132 acres and one free land title for 4 acres. The Assistant Superintendent of Lands left Sibu on the 6th to visit Binatang, Daro and Matu and returned on the 13th. A total of eighty-three patients were treated at Sibu hospital during the month. Sixty were dis- charged, and four deaths occurred in the hospital. The number of patients undergoing treatment , in the hospital is gradually declining. This, it is reported. is due to the poor state of the temporary hospital. Recently the heat in the wards during the day was very considerable. The death rate during the last few months is mounting, a number of patients being brought in "in extremis” and dying within 24 hours. It must also be borne in mind, however, that as the Chinese are now better off financially they prefer to try native medicines, and come to the hospital only when their finances are exhausted; by that time, of course, in most cases only a miracle can save them. Four hundred and fifty cases were treated in the out-patients department. Two hundred and twenty- four were new cases, and the remainder repetitions. Information was received from Sarikei that a mail bag for Binatang was stolen on the night of 6th. This case is still under investigation. The Sunshine Manila Revue, Malay Bangsawan, gave performances at the Yu Lok Theatre, Sibu, during the month. The District Officer, Lower Rejang, reports that there was no serious crime in his district during the month. As is usual at this time of the year, a few complaints of theft of pepper were reported, but the system of patrols from the garden police stations has reduced these offences to a minimum. On information received, one Bay Mah Tee, a Hokkien wharf-coolie, was arrested in Sarikei on August 22nd and charged with being concerned in the Song Treasury theft. When arrested he had over $700 in his possession. Apart from the usual descent of Dayaks on the Sarikei and Binatang bazaars at the start of the tapping holiday, very few Dayaks were seen during the month, being busy with their farms. A few of the usual farming-land disputes were reputed and satisfactorily s’ttled by the Native Officers. Rumah Girin, Sungei Sarikei, was destroyed by fire in the middle of a bcgawai. The conflagration was caused by firing a shot-gun through the leaf- attap roof at close range. The occupants were just sober enough to save themselves, but all property was lost. The sixty-year old wife of Tua Rumah Ukat caused the Penghulus some trouble by insisting on a divorce from her husband on the grounds that she is too old to take any further interest in married life, and sees no reason why she should spend her declining years cooking for her husband and his guests. As Ukat refuses to remain a Tua Rumah if his wife leaves him, there is a possibility that the house will break up and disperse. The pepper harvest at Sarikei and Binatang con¬ tinues, but the fruit is a poor colour owing to lack of good running water, while the gardeners attribute the smallness of the fruit to their inability to afford sufficient fertilizer at present, prices. The low price is very discouraging, as production from the non-diseased areas is better this year. The experimental vegetable garden at Sarikei yielded approximately one picul of vegetables for prison consumption. The Agricultural Inspector continued his inspec¬ tions of rubber and pepper gardens in the Sarikei An effort is being made to improve the quality of Dayak rubber by the issue of measures for the latex and strings to regulate the size of the finished sheets. Most Dayak sheets are so thick and heavy that it is impossible to smoke them properly. The following table gives the trade figures for Sarikei and Binatang for the month Exports and imports at the ports of Sarikei and Binatang were very heavy. The godowns at Binatang, indeed, are proving inadequate to accommodate the cargoes. The Officer-in-Charge, Matu and Daro, reports that Japanese fishing boats have been frequently sighted off Cape Sink. The lights of eighteen or twenty at a time have been observed at night from the lighthouse, but it is very difficult to say whether they are within the three-mile limit. Two Chinese launches on the Binatang-Matu run collided at Muara Payang on the evening of the 5th, m.l. Thai Ann being badly holed and ground¬ ing in shallow water just before she sank. The Juragans of both launches and the helmsman of one were charged under section 280 of the Penal Code, and two of the accused convicted and fined. A bag of mail consigned from Sarikei to Binatang was stolen from m.l. Hock Ann on the night of the 5th—6th and extensive police investigations failed tn discover any trace of the thief or thieves. Fortunately the bag contained only three un¬ important letters and a roll of duplicate vouchers. A Malay prahu paddling from Semah to Belawai on August 28th was struck by lightning during a violent storm. One of the occupants was killed instantly, two others were badly burnt and the remaining five suffered from shock. An inquiry was held by rhe Native Officer of Rejang. The Mee Ang Sawmill at Binatang, which re-opened a month or two ago, is showing signs of increased activity, and is producing planks for the local market. The empty land on the Nyelong side of Sarikei is now being opened up as a residential area. That the development is popular is shown by the eager¬ ness of the Chinese to acquire building sites, lots being taken up as soon as they are demarcated. All buildings will need the approval of the Govern¬ ment , and it is hoped that the present overcrowding in the bazaar will be relieved and that Sarikei as a town will be greatly improved. Bundan alias Jerani Manggai, a down-river Dayak, was sentenced to six months' imprisonment at Kapit for cheating by means of charms and spurious medicines. Penghulus Atan, Manok Manchal, Ugak, Ansi, Jagah, Grinang and Sibat visited Kapit during the month, in most cases to purchase barang for begawai. There have been an extraordinary number of these festivals this year due, no doubt, to excellent crops obtained last season. The mats paid by Punans for tax were auctioned at Kapit and brought fair prices, but they were few in number and not of good quality; this is due entirely to trading by Dayaks working jungle produce, and an effort is being made to remedy this. It may perhaps be worth mentioning as an exam¬ ple of Dayak character that a great many Dayaks now use tapping holidays as a means of calculating dates, and it is quite common to hear a Dayak date an incident by "Empai kena stop tangkal suba." On August 25th Penghulu Manok Manchal was caught holding a small tuba fishing in Sungei Kapit ulu for ngulit purposes; as I had spent a night in his house only a few days previously and lectured him on the subject, his offence is a glaring one and the case has not yet come up for trial pending consultation with the Resident. On August 12th N.O. Abang Ahmat returned from a four-day trip round ulu Chermin in connexion with outlaws affairs. An old outlaw langkau was discovered on top of one of the hills, but the Native Officer estimated its age as at least six months. Work has been commenced on the preparation of a demonstration vegetable plot behind the Court Writer’s house, Kapit, this is the only possible site but much work is necessitated in terracing the hill¬ side. This garden will be entirely separate from the prison garden on the edge of the river. On August 30th Mr. Spurway, Divisional Forest Officer, arrived with Mr. Gotte, a forest expert from the Bangkok branch of Messrs, the Borneo Company, Limited, preparatory to investigating the possibilities of commercially working the timber above Pelagus rapids in the Sungei Merit area. On August 7th a fire was discovered in an upstairs room in the old bazaar, Kapit. Fortunately it was discovered in time to prevent it spreading, and beyond some charred beams no serious damage was done. All attempts to trace the origin of the fire have failed. At Mukah. Tang Thiam Siu. a Chinese youth of uncertain occupation, was found guilty (under section 321 of the Penal Code) of assaulting a constable (No. G46 Nawi) at night in the bazaar, with a piece of wood, and was sentenced to one year’s rigorous imprisonment and nine strokes of the rattan. The price of sago remained comparatively low (55 cents) at Mukah in spite of a general rise to 70 cents in Dalat, and a maximum of 84 cents in Kuching. The reason given is that owing to the drought very little sago can be worked, which, one would think, should raise the price. The real reason, I am convinced, is that, the workers are all in debt and cannot or will not demand a fair price. Exports of raw sago from Mukah were :— The District Officer, Oya and Dalat, reports with regret that on August 19th Haji Abas bin Haji Ahmat died at Oya. He was for many years Tuan Imam of Oya mosque, and was well known and much respected throughout the district. For some years past Haji Abas had been in failing health, and he had lost his sight. The padi and sago godowns at Nanga Tamin, Ulu Oya, are in course of erection. Two Hokkien and two Foochow traders have been permitted to erect godowns. Both Hokkiens are in partnership and so are the Foochows. These two godowns are being erected on a previously selected site with a time limit of occupation of one year. It was decided to have two firms in residence at Nanga Tamin so as to avoid as far as possible any chance of undue profit being made, and to create a certain amount of competition. All four of these men have been trailing for many years in the Oya as bandong hawkers. The rumoured menace to sago palms by large numbers of bears from the Matu district was con¬ firmed, and permission has been granted to sell buckshot to local trustworthy Melanaus. It is hoped that this will help local people to protect their gardens, but it is unlikely that it will completely cope with the problem. The price of raw sago reached a new high level during the month, the price at Dalat being 70 cents per pasu and at the Kut 78 cents. The amount of raw sago exported from the district decreased during the month, the figures being :— This shows a total decrease of 15 koyans on the figures for last month. One motor schooner, one motor launch, six schooners and twenty-five bandongs cleared Oya during the month, the total tonnage being 669 tons, a decrease on the figures for last month of 123 tons. Dalat Regatta. For the first time for ten years a Regatta was held at Dalat on His Highness the Tuan Muda’s birthday. August 8th. It was originally decided to hold the event as long ago as last February, since it was necessary to give as much time as possible for local people to build their boats, select crews, etc. Programmes were printed in English and Chinese. A certain number of Malay copies in Jawi were written by hand locally. Intense excitement prevailed in the Oya district for the two months preceding the Regatta, and inter-Kampong races were to be seen in progress on most evenings. As a result of this the form of most of the crews and boats was pretty well known by Regatta day. The weather, which had previously been unsettled, bucked up for the occasion, and there was no rain. Stands for the Judges, totalizator and spectators were erected by the flag-staff, and additional hawkers' stalls and food-stalls were in abundance. The crowds of people lining both banks of the river throughout the day were phenomenal. Racing started punctually at 8.30 a.m. and ran to programme. As most of the finishes were so close the judges did not have an enviable job. The tote proved very popular, and was most efficiently run hy the Hon. Treasurer, Mr. Jack Douglas, and Mr. Sim Cheng Chiew. It paid very good money, but not to me personally ! Awang Bunyok, N.O., the Hon. Secretary, did sterling work both before and during the Regatta, making himself responsible for a multitude of things which could not have been better done. As regards the more important races, the “31” of Kampong Ud in Class “A” was a popular win, Haji Omar’s boat giving them a close run. The Queen Mary was more or less expected to win Class "B”, although she is actually a bad boat, but the general opinion is that the Dalat paddlers are so good that they could paddle a log into first place. In Classes "A” and ”B” of the 15-men boats, the most outstanding were Laju Laju and Jempaka Welis. Tn both races the finish was a close one. The Champion Cup, 30-men race, was “terriffic,” there being no other word to describe it. The course is about three miles long, and Queen Mary won by j a bare two feet from Singa Kala,—truely a remark¬ able race. It was revealed afterwards that the steersman of Singa Kala fainted 200 yards from the winning post, otherwise the answer might have been different. In the Champion Cup, 15-men Class, there was also intense excitement and it is the general opinion of all who witnessed the race that Laju Laju of Oya thoroughly deserved her win. Barong races, of which there were two, caused amazement amongst the spectators, since bearing in mind their ungainly size and blunt bows they showed an amazing turn of speed. After the races the cups and cash prizes were presented to the winners in the Government Offices by Mr. C. D. Adams, Resident, Third Division. Visitors to Dalat for the occasion included Messrs. A. Macpherson, R. W. Hammond, G. Farrelley. R. W. Bormond and Dr. J. S. M. de Raaf of the Sarawak Oilfields, Limited. Not by any means the least surprising event of the Regatta took place when the Committee realized they had actually made a profit of some $30 odd, which will be carried forward for future use on similar occasions. It is hoped that events of this kind will again be organized in the Oya river, as amongst the Melanau people they are most popular, and very easy to run, with the help and encouragement which the Com¬ mittee can expect to receive from everybody. —(Contributed.) DALAT REGATTA. After the finish of the last race six ducks were released into the river. Any person who could out- swim the ducks and capture them could have them. All the ducks were eventually captured after much amusement. INTERVAL FOR LUNCH. A curry tiffin was held in the Government Offices for all officials of the Regatta by kind invitation of Mr Chua Hoi Tiaw and Mr. Sim Cheng Chiew. Fourth Division News. AUGUST. The competition between the Ranee’s and Grand Cinemas at Miri has begun. It is remarkable how much money natives and Chinese have to spend on this sort of entertainment, especially as many of the films are hardly likely to interest them. From their point of view it seems a pity that there are not more films of actual events, or some of the very interesting educational films to be seen in England. Two inquests at Miri were held during the month. In one, on the body of a Kedayan named Sidop, who was alleged to have been shot acciden¬ tally by a friend while hunting, an open verdict was returned, and the friend, by name Untong, was sentenced subsequently in the Resident’s Court to six months’ rigorous imprisonment for causing death by a rash act. In the other a verdict of suicide was returned. The new slaughter-house at Sungei Krokop, Miri, was completed during the month, but was not put in use. Satisfactory progress was made with the new kampong area at Sungei Merbau, and several applications were received for sites. Contracts were signed for new Clerks' Quarters and a gaol fence, but work had not begun at the end of the month. At Limbang, an alleged case of infanticide was investigated which proved to be unfounded. The rumour emanated from a gossiping stepmother, who was duly admonished. No arrests have yet been made in connection with the Limbang burglaries reported last month. Subsidized pepper planters at Panderuan pro¬ duced 40 bags for shipment to Kuching by the Maimuna on 17th. The Chinese School Committee at Limbang pro¬ pose to negotiate for a fresh site on which to erect a school building in place of the present converted shophouse in the bazaar. The former District Officer inspected some possible suitable sites, which are not easy to locale. Visitors to Limbang during the month included Mr. and Mrs. Davidson, Mr. and Mrs. Tolley, and infant, Messrs. Bewsher and Young, all of the Borneo Evangelical Mission, also Mr. Hughes- Hallett, M.C.S., Assistant Resident, Belait, Messrs. Perrott and Tilman of Messrs, the Asiatic Petroleum Company, Mr. and Mrs. Bomphrey and Messrs. Coghill and Giffening of Brunei. The District Officer, Bintulu, reports that Dayaks and Malays have completed their burning and in most cases obtained fairly clean burns. At the moment, though, the whole district is overrun with wild pigs; it would appear that these pests are going to do a great deal of harm to the young padi in the near future. At Bintulu work was commenced on the new conservancy scheme: a back lane has been cut in the down-river block of the bazaar, and shop- owners have commenced the construction of their latrines. 8ix latrines for the up-river block were completed by contract. The middle block is proving more difficult, as the houses are in a bad state and all of different length. A scheme has been drawn up to deal with them. Mr. C. E. L. Blagg, Registrar of the supreme Court, visited Bintulu from August 27th to 29th, in connection with the affairs of the Sarawak Timber and Trading Co., Ltd., which Company is in liquidation. On the night of August 26th a strong fresh from the ulu broke up several of the Sarawak Timber and Trading Company’s log rafts at Pandan; about •200 logs broke loose and floated up and down the river. Special coolies had to be called out to collect these logs where possible, and it is not yet known how many of them are missing. The District Officer, Baram. states that the shortage of rice in his district becomes more serious every day, and Government help is being sought on all sides. Approximately two thousand dollars of the sum set aside for relief has been spent, and it is known that the majority of people requiring assistance have not yet come down. Everyone is holding out until the new crop is safely planted. It is expected that as many as fifty villages will apply for relief, and when it is realised that the majority of these are long houses of about fifty doors, some of a hundred, it will be understood that it is no easy matter for the chiefs to provide food, as is expected of them, and that it is almost certain the original vote for relief will be insufficient. In some cases, in certain houses in the Tinjar for instance, other crops planted may help them to last until the harvest, but in almost all other villages, especially in the Baram and Tutoh rivers, one and every crop has failed. The wandering Penans have taken the precaution of finishing all the wild sago in the neighbourhood of the main river villages, so that driven to this last resource, the Kenyahs and Kayane have to travel for two and three days before they can find sufficient to eat. The adult ran subsist on a varied diet of unusual items and go hungry for days without much ill effect. It is the children who suffer, and the natives themselves say that several have already died through under-nourishment. One bad harvest now and then does not much matter; it is when two and three follow one another that things become serious. The Dayaks, on the whole, and the Kelabits have had a sufficient harvest. The latter, in so far as they are able, are assisting their less for¬ tunate neighbours, but they live far in the interior and it is a wearisome business carrying rice over the hills. Below are extracts from a report by Mr. D. Q. Hudden. Acting District Officer, Baram, on a visit to the Kelabit country :— "I left Marudi for the Kelabit country on the 25th May. and returned on the 28th August. This would appear to be a long time, but when one considers the distance travelled and the places visited, it is not excessive. In addition, one must remember that these people had not been visited for several years, so that they were due for a longer visit than usual. “There are four ways of approaching this country, and die visits in the past have generally been done in two journeys. With only one European in the district it is perhaps better to do it this way, as it does not necessitate leaving Marudi for so long. "Since Mohamad Zin Galau, Native Officer, was unable to go I was accompanied by Probationary Native Officer Wan Ali and Peng- hulu Tama Tingang Malang. The latter was invaluable, and I cannot stress too much his courtesy and skill in dealing with every occasion, expected or unforeseen. We started by way of the Apoh and Melanah and then crossed the watershed to Long Mutan on the upper Tutoh. Here there is a rest hut, and Kelabit boats were waiting for our use. We travelled down the Tutoh and up to the Saridan, where the first Kalabit houses are situated. On the way up we met Mr F. H. Buxton, Assistant Forest Officer, returning to his survey work in the Tutoh after revictualling his party in the nearest village. Most of the Saridan Kelabits have moved over the boundary from time to time, and the remnant is only some fifty or sixty doors. From the Saridan we started to climb on to the Boyu range which stretches almost as far as Batu Lawi and Bukit Murud. The path leads along the top of this range, the boundary between the Baratu and Limbang districts, and one can see for miles on either side. Several nights, when camping, we descended a short distance to find water on the Limbang side. Pigs were very plentiful, and also leeches, a result, perhaps, of the continual rain which we were experiencing at that time. Eventually we descended to the head¬ waters of the Magoh, crossed this stream some ten or a dozen times, and then climbed the range between the Magoh and the Keba’an. There are four villages in the Keba’an valley amongst which may be included the small house on the Englah river. The main Kelabit population resides in the upper reaches of the Baram and Lebun rivers. The soil is very fertile and they invariably have exceptionally good harvest. Sickness in this area is appalling, and with a travelling medicine chest one can do little to alleviate it. Several epidemics are said to have occurred during recent years, and the numbers of the inhabitants have decreased considerably. I am convinced that with proper medical attention the large death rate amongst these people and amongst the other upriver tribes can be materially reduced. The addition of even one dresser would be of help, since one could then spend his time travelling and one remain in charge of the hospital. I believe that formerly there were two dressers in this district. “At Lemudu, the house of the late penghulu .Tama Abu Tingang, a gathering of headmen was called to decide on the most suitable person to take his place. Without a dissentient voice it was agreed that Tabaran Ribu, the late chief's son, was the only person acceptable to them, and indeed since his father's death he had acted as their unofficial chief. We were requested to inform His Highness the Rajah, through the Resident, Fourth Division, and to ask that Tabaran Ribu be created Penghulu in his father’s place. At Lio Matu several members of the party succumbed to fever and on Mohamad Zin Galan's arrival it was arranged that most of those originally accompanying me had better return home from Long Akah. This was done, and Wan Ali with Tama Tingang Malang returned whilst we proceeded up the Akah to the Kayans and Kelabits there, and to the one Kelabit village in the headwaters of the Tutoh, only two hours from the Akah valley. We returned to Marudi via the Selungau, the Pata and the Apoh.' One inquest was held during the month at Taiwas on the body of a Tagal of Ulu Merapok who died of tuba poisoning. A verdict, of suicide was returned. There was once again, as usual, an almost com¬ plete absence of crime in the Lawas district. Very few Muruts appeared in Lawas during the month, but a large crowd assembled at Trusan to have several old outstanding cases settled during the Officer-in-Charge’s monthly visit there. These cases were mostly land and inheritance disputes, and were all cleared up. The Lawas (Sarawak) Estates, Ltd., exported 28,683 lbs. of dry rubber during the month. THE PRICE KUCHING, Friday, May 1st, 1936. 20 CENTS. The FRIDAY. MAY 1st, 1936. Local and Personal. APRIL. His Highness the Rajah returned to Kuching from his visit to Baram and Miri on April 11th, accompanied by Dayang Valerie and Mrs. C. D. Adams. Mrs. Adams returned to Sibu by m.v. Rejang on the 13th. His Highness the Tuan Muda and Dayang Anne are due to arrive in Singapore on May 10th, having travelled out from home by the Rampura the vessel that is conveying back to China, the art treasures recently exhibited on loan at Burlington House. Their Highnesses embarked at Marseilles, and so were not on hoard the ship when she went aground at Gibraltar. On March 4th Mr. H. B. Crocker, Acting Government Secretary, left Sarawak in order to proceed to Europe on three months’ sick leave. With him were Mr. and Mrs. R. L. Daubeny, who are now on furlough. Mr. W. F. Dick, Resident, First Division, has taken Mr. Crocker’s place as Acting Government Secretary, and Mr. Pollard is acting temporarily as Resident, First Divi¬ sion. Kuching was almost empty of Europeans over Easter, the cricket team that visited Miri and holiday parties at Santubong and Sibu' Laut making a large hole in the European community. H.R.H. Prince Purachatra of Siam arrived in Kuching on April 10th in connection with the establishment and organisation of the Kuching Rotary Club. An account of the Prince’s visit appears in another column. Mr. E. Parnell, Treasurer of Sarawak, left on furlough by the Vyner Brooke on April 27th. having been preceded by Mrs. Parnell, who sailed a fortnight earlier. Mr. H. M. Calvert is acting as Treasurer during Mr. Parnell's absence. Mr. L. D. Kennedy has been appointed Acting Com¬ missioner of Trade and Customs. H.I.J.M.S. Yunbari. with Rear-Admiral B. Hosogaya, who is paying a visit to Kuching, is due to arrive at Pending on May 4th. “Jane's Fighting Ships" states that the Yunbari is a second-class cruiser of 2,890 tons with a complement of 328. We record with deep regret the death of Tuanku Haji Ali bin Tuanku Hussein, which look place at Sibu on April 13th. Tuanku Haji Ali was a Malay gentleman of great distinction and charm, and counted many close friends among Europeans in Sarawak; he was also greatly liked and respected by the Malay community, with whom he had con¬ siderable influence. His eyesight failed some time ago. and for several months before his death he was completely blind Tuanku Haji Ali leaves a widow and three sons, two of whom are in the Native Officers’ Service. An obituary notice appears else¬ where in this issue. During the month Mr. G. F. J Pegler, Acting District Officer, Kuching, paid a short visit to Sambas. N.E.I., in order to discuss with the Gezaghebber of that station certain problems regarding the Lundu N.E.I. border. Mr. Pegler, who was accompanied by Mr. R. G. Aikman,returned to Kuching on April 24th. An R.A.F. Flying-boat from Seletar. with Squadron Leader Lloyd. Flight Lieutenant R. A. A. Cole and Flying Officer H. J. Hobbs, was due to arrive at Kuching on the morning of April 15th on a tour of inspection of flying-boat moorings at Pending, Sibu. Bin- tulu and Miri. The flying-boat, ran into a violent storm, however, when approaching the Sarawak coast, and was forced to land at Pulo Sempadi. where rough seas damaged her tail plane. She was unable to proceed on her flight, and spent the night at Sempadi; the following morning, the sea being reasonably calm, she taxied to Pending, being piloted through the Santubong entrance by m.l. Betty, which had been sent to Sempadi the previous evening for this purpose. A spare tail-plane arrived from Singapore by the Darrel on April 20th. and was fitted shortly afterwards. During the night, how¬ ever, the trunk of a nipah. palm, which had become dislodged from the river bank, tore the lower main plane, and the departure of the flying-boat was again delayed. She eventually left for Sibu on the 24th, and returned to Kuching on May 1st after com¬ pleting her tour; Mr. J. B. Archer, Resident, Fourth Division, took passage by her from Miri in order to attend the Spring Race Meeting. The flying-boat left for Singapore on May 4th. We hear that H.M.S. Herald is expected to call al Pending early in May on her way to the Rejang, where she will continue the hydrographic survey of the river. The survey parties will camp near Sarikei. Owing to unforeseen circumstances the publication of the Gazette has been delayed this month.

SARAWAK. Rubber Regulation during 1935. REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN, RUBBER RESTRICTION COMMITTEE. 1. Under the International Agreement to Regulate Production and Export of Rubber, Sarawak was allotted a basic quota of 28,000 tons for the year 1935. By decision of the International Rubber Regulation Committee the following Permissible Exportable Amounts were allowed : — The unused balance carried over from 1931 amounted to 1,391 tons, thereby giving a total available for export during the year of 20,291 tons. Exports during the year, excluding 180 Ions under Customs control on 31st December, 1934. amounted to 19,285 tons (dry equivalent), leaving an unused balance of 1,006 tons to be carried forward to the succeeding year. Exports of rubber from the State were dis¬ tributed as follows :— Rubber produced in the Second Division is exported from the First Division. All rubber exported from the State was accompanied by certificate of origin, duly authenticated, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. 2. Legislation.—Order No. R—3 (Rubber Restriction) 1931 was amended by the enactment of Order No. R—3B (Rubber Restriction Amendment) 1935, dated 5th January, 1935, Order No. R—3c (Rubber Restriction Amendment) 1935. dated 29th August. 1935. and Order No. R—3D (Rubber Restriction Amendment) 1935, dated 5th December. 1935. The object of the first amendment was to facilitate control of stocks of rubber held by Dealers and Exporters licensed under Order No R—4 (Rubber Dealers and Exporters) 1934. The second amendment was promulgated with the object of tightening the control regarding the replacement of rubber trees. A provision regarding the eradication of seedlings was included, but since this measure gave rise to much dissatisfaction and complaint of being impracticable and unenforceable it was repealed by the third amendment. In addition, the rules regard¬ ing tapping methods. Notification No. 767 of 1931, were repealed by Notification No. 1127 of 19th September, 1935, since it was found impossible to enforce them in the majority of outlying districts. 3. The Rubber Restriction Committee, consist¬ ing of the following ex officio members, continued throughout the year to deal with matters pertaining to Rubber Restriction : The Commissioner of Trade and Customs (Chairman). The Resident, First Division. The Secretary for Chinese Affairs. The Senior Agricultural Officer. Nine meetings of the Committee were held during the year. 4. The strict control and limitation of immigra¬ tion referred to in the previous report was continued during the year and doubtless continued to be a main feature in restricting production of rubber, though it must operate to the disadvantage of other industries. Before the year had far advanced, however, it became apparent that it would prove inadequate as a means of keeping exports of rubber within the limits imposed by the Agreement and that recourse would have to he had to one or more lapping holidays. During the year two tapping holidays were declared as follows (i) from 8th to 28th July, inclusive. (ii) from 27th October to 18th November, inclusive. Staff's of various Departments, such as Land and Survey. Forest, Agriculture and Constabulary assisted as far as possible with patrol work during the holidays. Reports indicate that on the whole the holidays were faithfully observed throughout the State, and monthly statistics of exports and stocks tend to confirm this, though the first holiday was perhaps the more convincing. Dissatisfaction was voiced in various quarters by certain sections of the community concerned in the rubber industry ; it is dear that the system is not ideal and introduces abnormal difficulties, and holidays may not continue to lie so successful. Each holiday was preceded by propaganda as intensive as circumstances permitted, and it is probably true to say that the majority of Native and oilier Asiatic small-holders, of which a large proportion of the rubber producers of the State consists, appreciate and accept the position. There can be no doubt that the production of rubber generally is increasing, and that more native holdings have been brought into tapping, probably due partly to the natural incentive of higher prices, and to labour leaving other industries, chiefly pepper, which are less remunerative than rubber at the present level of commodity values. 5. It was decided to carry out a census of rubber planted throughout the State, and a start was made early in June but the work was not completed before the end of the year. An Officer of the Administra¬ tive Service and an Officer of the Land and Survey Department were seconded for this work and a temporary subordinate staff was engaged. Mr. C. E. J. Pascoe. formerly of the Land Department, was appointed Superintendent of Rubber Restriction in August. 6. The purchase and sale of rubber are controlled by Order No. R—4 (Rubber Dealers and Exporters) 1934, under which deniers and exporters are licensed to deal in and export rubber. The maximum amount of rubber which the holder of a licence may have in stock at any one time is prescribed on the licence. On 31st December, 1935, there were 1415 licensed dealers and licensed exporters distributed throughout the State as follows : 7. Considering the circumstances under which rubber is grown widespread throughout the State and the inherent difficulties nf effecting an adequate measure of immediate supervision, the number of prosecutions it was found necessary to institute was comparatively small. 8. A provisional programme of four tapping holidays for the year 1936 was arranged. C. D. LE GROS CLARK . Chairman, Rubber Restriction Committee. Rotary in Kuching. H.K.H. Prince Purachatra, Governor of the 80th District R.I.. arrived in Kuching on 13th April, and left on the I8th. During his short visit he was kept very busy with functions, visits, sight¬ seeing, etc. On the first night of his arrival he was the guest of Messrs. Wong Shuk Chee and Khan Ah Chong at a Dinner at the Government Rest House where he was staying. On the second day he checked up work of the organization of the Rotary Club carried out by Mr. Khan Ah Chong, and at night he presided over the Inaugural Meeting. On the third day the Prince was enter¬ tained at dinner by Capt. C. D. Le Gros Clark, after he had been up to Ban in the morning visiting some gold mines and seeing their method of working. The Prince was accompanied by Dr. Wong Cheong Way. who gave him some gold as a souvenir of the occasion. Mr. Ong Seng Chai entertained the party to a big tiffin at his house at Siniawan. On the following day at noon Prince Purachatra together with Mr. Khan Ah Chong called on His Highness the Rajah of Sarawak and thanked him for his patronage in becoming an Honorary Member of the Kuching Rotary Club In the afternoon Mr. Ong Tiang Swee, regarded as the G.O.M. of Kuching, gave a tea party to about 40 Chinese friends. Mr. Khun Ah Chong spoke welcoming the Prince on behalf of Mr. Ong Tiang Swee. The Prince expounded the theories of Rotary which were duly interpreted into Chinese to the audience, and which made a deep impression on those present, who dispersed afterwards very much wiser regarding ideals of Rotary. At night the Prince paid a visit to the Sylvia Cinema, and was pleased with the nice building. Friday was devoted to sight-seeing, and the jelutong and sago factories of Ong Ewe Hai were visited. The factories of the same nature belonging to Mr. Ong Tiang Swee were also seen prior to this. The Prince is very interrated in orchids, and he was taken to a house of a Chinese where he saw and wsn very interested in a few very rare specimens. In the evening the Museum and the Malay Kam- pongs came under the Prince’s itinerary. The Dayak village at the 21st Mile, Kampong Segu, was not forgotten. Wherever he went his camera and eine-Koilak came in useful, and he took quite a number of photos which should prove valuable as a reminiscence of his visit. On the night previous to his departure the Prince was the guest at a fare¬ well party by Messrs. E. Parnell and L. N. Reynolds. On the morning of the 18th the Prince was seen off by practically every Rotarian, includ¬ ing the President. Mr. H. M. Calvert. Red Letter Day for Sarawak Rotary. April 14th was a red letter day to Sarawak because she joined the great world-wide family of Rotary on that day. At night time the Inaugural Meeting was held at the Government Rest House with a Dinner attended by a Charter Membership of 26, consisting of officials and business and professional men of the town and representing several different nationalities and racial groups. The gathering, indeed, exemplified the unique character of Rotary. The Charter members with their classifications are as follows ;— H.R.H. Prince Purachatra, Governor of 80th District R.T., was in the chair and after dinner was over. Mr. Khan Ah Chong opened the business side of the meeting with the passing of the Club constitution and by-laws. He stated that the constitution and by-laws could not he printed off yet, as there were some points that had to be decided and some other information to be obtained, but he assured the members that a copy would be sent to every one as soon as they were ready. The election of Office Bearers resulted as follows :— Under the heading of election of Honorary Members Mr. Khan All Chong stated that he had great pleasure in announcing that H.H. The Rajah of Sarawak would be very pleased to accept the honour of Honorary Membership. He eulogized the Rajah’s fine qualities as the sovereign bead and stated that the peace and harmony in which the people of different nationalities were living bore great testimony to bis wise and able administration, and it would be a great honour to have him amongst the Rotarians. The Rajah was then unanimously elected Honorary Member amid great applause. Mr. Khan Ah Chong further said :— There is another man who deserves the distinction of an Honorary Membership and that is, the ‘Grand Old Man’ of Kuching, Mr. Ong Tiang Swee. He has consented to accept that honour. Mr. Ong Tiang Swee is a man of about 70 years of age. He was born and bred in Kuching, and has done a lot of public work for the State and in recognition of his loyalty and philanthropy he has been honoured by tlie Rajah with a C.S.S. (Companion of the Star of Sarawak) and so far he is the only man in Kuching who has received such an honour. He was the first Chinese Magistrate for the Chinese Court, which has since been abolished, and was also the first President of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. As a matter of fact he plays a purl in all things Chinese and often acts as a mediator between the Government and his community, it is certainly to such a man that we should bestow an honour such as Honorary Membership.” The election was received with much enthusiasm and Mr. Ong Tiang Swee was duly elected an Honorary Member. After the above business Mr. Khan Ah Chong addressed the Meeting. He said "To-day is a red letter day for Sarawak, It is put on the Rotary- map through the birth of its Rotary baby. The baby is born under the best auspices, burn with a silver spoon in its mouth, and born from the best parentage in having as its father the Treasurer of the Slate, Mr. II. M. Calvert, and its mother, the Gold King. Dr. Wong Cheong Way, both of whom. I am sure, will nurse it to be a healthy and lusty son who will play a great part in and uplift the tradition of Rotary. We must congratulate ourselves for having secured the services of two such excellent gentlemen. You cannot find two more likeable and two more popular men in the whole of Kuching. They are pre-eminently suited to perform the functions of leaders in the newly-formed Rotary Club by virtue of their broad sympathies, geniality, and graciousness. Mr. Calvert is very popular among the Europeans and other communities in Kuching while Dr. Wong Cheong Way is the most respected, amiable and beloved of men in his own community. He is strongly entrenched in the affection of his own people. In spite of the able guidance of the President and Vice-President , I must still appeal to all members of our Club to exert their goodwill, friendship, comradeship and co-operation to make Rotary a success that it desenes." (Applause). "Now I will introduce to you H.R.H. Prince Purachatra. who is the Governor of 80th District in Rotary International. It is very kind of him to have come all the distance from Singapore to set this Club going, and the fact that he has to stay here for about a week is certainly a great sacrifice of his time, but where sacrifice is concerned with Rotary, he is ever ready to give way to it. He is the keenest Rotarian I have ever come across, and as the District Governor lie is giving about 80%, of his time to the cause of Rotary. To be chosen as the District Governor out of about 500 Rotarians in the 80th District undoubtedly bears great testimony to his popularity and ability." (Applause). H.R. H. Prince Purachatra was then cailed upon to give his address. H.R.H. Prince Purachatra said :—"Fellow Rotarians, Mr. Khan Ah Chong gave an analogy of the birth of the Kuching Rotary Club and referred to Mr. Calvert and Dr. Wong Cheong Way as its father and mother respectively. I would like to check him here. He himself is really the mother whilst Mr. Calvert and Dr. Wong are only the nurses who have to nurse and bring up the child. I am, as it were, the father and, I have had two babies within a month, one was born in Taiping, F.M.8., and the other is bom here to-night. I must give you a few brief facts about Rotary. Rotary undertakes to inspire men to realize fully their individual capacity for patriotic citizenship in their State and nation, to give a square deal to their employees, their customers, and their business and professional associates and. individually and through their association in Rotary Club, to bring about understanding, goodwill and international peace through a world fellowship of business and professional men united in the ideal of service. Rotary is not a religious body nor is it a political one. it has no secrets and its success lies upon those three facts. Rotary used to have six objects which have now been reduced to four. They are simple and yet are so noble. I would like to stress on the point of internationalism. There are two kinds of internationalism, the internal and external. The internal one only confines itself to the limits of the country in which you live and you can develop friendship and goodwill among all races and nationalities through that. The external inter¬ nationalism has a wider aspect. No matter to whichever country you go, where Rotary Clubs exist, you will meet and make new friends and through this, understanding and goodwill will arise. I will not dwell at length on the four objects of Rotary because they cannot be better sum¬ marized than by the lines which I will quote now :— "Red rose, for the living, and handclasps warm and true, A heart that’s tuned to giving, and strength to dare And do: The sound of honest laughter, the joy of honest toil; For those that follow after, to leave a finer soil. All this has been and ever will be the Notary plan. A man's sincere endeavour to serve his fellownum. "A little seeking, a little more for men, Less hitter in our speaking, more kindly with the pen; A little loss of swerving from paths of truth and right, A little more of serving, and less of dollar might, More peaceful with our neighbours, and stauncher to our friends. For tins all Rotary labours, on this its hope depends. "To smooth the way for others, to make of life the most; To make the phrase "our brother" mean more than ideal boast; To praise sincere endeavour, when praise will spur it on; Withholding kind words never until the friend is gone; "This is the Rotary spirit, this is the Rotary dream, God grant that we may near it, before we cross (he stream." I will not detain you any longer here as there arc some things more interesting upstairs.” (Applause.) Mr. E. Parnell thanked the Prince for his in¬ spiring address and wished the new Club every success. Then the gathering was treated to some very interesting films about Mexico Convention last year and the District Conference held at Ipoh at the beginning of this month. Persaudaraan Sahabat Pena Malaya. (BROTHERHOOD OF PEN FRIENDS), The members of the Persaudaraan Sahabat Pena Malaya held their third Annual Reunion Tiffin at Woodford's Bungalow. Tanjong Bungah, Penang, on Saturday, April 12th, 1936. About 220 mem¬ bers from all parts of Malaya sat down to tiffin, and a very happy afternoon was spent. Before tiffin was served, the President, Mr. S. M. Zainul Abidin, B.A. (London). in his opening speech welcomed all the members, and addressing the gathering in Malay, gave a short review of the aims and objects of the Brotherhood. Mr. Abidin said: "This is the third Reunion Tiffin we have had during the two years' existence of our Brotherhood, and this is the first occasion it is held in Penang, the Headquarters of the Brotherhood. To-day's attendance surpasses all those at previous Reunion meetings, and I am immensely pleased that so many representatives from all parts of Malaya have taken a great deal of trouble to travel all the way to Penang to attend this Reunion Function. You will be glad to hear that our membership to-day is 3,100 (applause). Our aims and objects which are in accordance with the tenets of our religion, attract members, aud the move on the part of our Brotherhood to enrich our language and literature is gaining popularity by leaps and bounds, in spite of the existence of some who place obstacles in our way. "This representative gathering, unique in the history of Malays of Malaya, is a testimony that our people are becoming conscious of the poverty of our literature. Let us all co-operate and strive hard to carry out our aims faithfully. You will presently hear some short addresses by our mem¬ bers in connection with those aims, and I ask you to listen to them without prejudice. Some of the ideas expressed may be a little too lofty just now for our Brotherhood to put into practice. We should be patient and carry out some of those ideas slowly. We have established our Library and Reading Room in Penang, but it will take some time before books can he properly catalogued and issued. I hope you realise rhe difficulty of running a library. "Some of our members fear that the member¬ ship is getting too big to be under proper control. I should like to bring home to you that our money is safe in the Chartered Bank, and with our present system of keeping accounts, the General Committee in Penang could cope even with a membership ten times as large. We should enrol the right type of members, who are really lovers of literature, those who are keen and arc willing to work for the community. We have before us a bright future, and our literary aims and objects if carried out along a straight path, will be crowned with success. On behalf of Penang members I extend to you a sincere welcome to Penang." The Hon. General Secretary next read a message of good wishes from Sarawak. The following members then delivered the undermentioned addresses :— At the conclusion of the speeches the President thunked the speakers, the various sub-committees for the excellent arrangements and the Hon. General Secretory, Mr. S. A. Alhady, for his untiring efforts to make the function the success that it was. In the evening a Tea Party was held amidst the musical strains of the Sri Majlis Kronchong Party, after which a group photograph was taken. Raja Hussain of Johore, one of the members, then enter¬ tained the gathering to an excellent conjuring show, at the conclusion of which the very happy and picturesque assembly in Malay costume dis¬ persed, so most of the members leaving by night mail the mine evening. The weather, which was fine throughout the day, added to the conviviality of the occasion. It is probable that the next Reunion Tiffin will be held in Singapore. —(Contributed.)

An Apology. It has been pointed out to me that my letter to the children in a recent issue of the Borneo Chronicle about “Unwanted Children" has misled people into thinking that child-slavery and infanticide are com¬ monly practised in Sarawak and Borneo. This is of course not so, and I much regret that such a meaning should has been read into my words, and I wish to apologise for giving such a wrong impression, and to add my conviction that of course the authorities concerned would never knowingly coun¬ tenance such customs. The point of the letter was to bring to notice the sad fact that many children are unwanted. The customs referred to are, I am told, practised in some parts of China.—W. LINTON. Sylvia Cinema. First Division News. MARCH. Seventy-two civil and fifty-two criminal cases came before the Kuching Courts during March. On March 28th, the body of an old Chinese named Goh Lau Choo was found in a house at Chin Chiang Sawmills, Padungan, and on the 31st the body of a Chinese named Lim Ah Pow was found lying on the Pending Road at the 3rd mile. Tn both cases in view of the medical evidence no inquest was held. Mr. G. F. J. Pegler, Acting District Officer, Kuching, left for Lundu on March 17th, returning on the 24th. Much of this time was spent in visiting Dayak villages. Apart from a number of rubber restriction offences, no serious crime was reported in the Ban district during March. Five hundred and fifty-nine persons were treated at the Government Dispensary during the month. One hundred and ten N.A.B. injections were given, and sixteen minor operations were per¬ formed. The kampongs in the Jagoi area were visited by the District Officer, Bau, according to programme. All Chiefs in that district were warned about rubber smuggling, tuba fishing, and the planting of rubber. The main Bau Road shewed a definite improve¬ ment during March, but daily rain has not assisted much. It was decided that the Jugan end S. Ikan roads should be closed to wheel traffic, and main¬ tained as footpaths only. Work has commenced on the new car park; the road from "Simpang Besar" to Bridge No. 1 has been enlarged, and will shortly be open for two- way traffic. Native Officer Abang Haji Adenan proceeded up the Left Hand Branch on March 16th to investi¬ gate the boundary dispute between Senah and Dutch Dayaks. He returned on the 29th; when his maps and reports are completed they will be handed to the Survey Office for fixing, and later a decision will be given. While away, Abang Haji Adenan visited Kam- pongs Semban, Jogong. Keding' Kekas, Brang Tebessey, Brang Wah, Senah Sadir, Bedut and Tepoi, in addition to other Kampongs which had already Ireeii visited this year. The following table gives the individual output of gold from the various mines for March, 1936 : On March 3rd, a Malay named Talip bin Abas was fined $500 at Lundu for smuggling rubber into Sarawak. Apart from this there was no serious crime in die Lundu district. Hill padi in the Lundu district is ripening well, and the crop promises to be good; rats and insect pests, however, have done extensive damage to the swamp padi, and it looks as though the harvest will hardly be worth collecting. Chinese named See Heng Lee from Samunsan was taken by a crocodile on March 17th while crossing Sungei Belinsah. The corpse was recovered the following day. At Serian thee appeal of Kampong Slabi against the District Court's decision in their land dispute case with Kampong Sroban was dismissed with costs. Appellants have since appealed to the Supreme Court i • Nissa Shokai Estate. Ltd., Samarahan. was fined $200 for breach of Order R—3 section 9 (i) by planting rubber. Five Malays from Tebekang were fined for tapping rubber during the February tapping holiday. One Chinese from Samarahan and one from Gedong were found storing rubber in excess of the amounts allowed in their licences. The rubber was confiscated and burned. On March 15th. the body of a baby about three days old was found floating in the Samarahan river. Police are making investigations, as this is obviously a case of a mother, probably Malay, doing away with an unwanted child. A Melanau from Mukah named Abu employed with the survey party at present at Tebekang died of cerebral malaria .on March 23rd at Sedan, and was buried next day at Tebekang. The Serian office has been full of Dayaks every day paying in their gun tax. There has been a considerable amount of fever at Serian and Tebekang; otherwise the health of the district has been satisfactory. A report was received from Smrah that three Chinese from Jemukan while sailing to Kuching were upset off Tanjong Sampun on March 11th. One managed to get ashore, but the other two were drowned, one body not being recovered. St. Thomas’ School. JUBILEE APPEAL. "Time alone can tell” is a common expression of hope mingled with fear in any new project, and this, no doubt, was the comforting and encouraging thought in the minds of the founders of this school fifty years ago. Time indeed has told its tale, and the school has more than justified the faith and hope of those responsible for its inception. From a mere handful of boys, the scholars now number close on five hundred. During the last fifty years thousands of boys have passed through its portals, and, as educated men they have proved themselves capable of taking their places as worthy citizens of the State. It is without any sense of pride or boastfulness that we state the well known fact that St. Thomas' boys are to be found amongst the leaders of both the Chinese and Malay com¬ munities in Sarawak, holding responsible positions in many walks of life. Through times of prosperity and times of depres¬ sion there has flowed from the school a steady stream of young men, trained, not only in scholar¬ ship, but also in character and knowledge of the high purpose, for which the school stands. The School has always aimed at providing a good education for all, irrespective of race or creed, rich or poor and has been ready to help deserving boys, by giving free or partly free education. Frequently the school takes the place of parents and homes, and provides food, clothing and shelter as well as education for needy boys. Year by year the burden of providing for these boys falls on the school finances and on the kindness of friends in England. In appreciation of what has been done in the past, a fitting commemoration of our Golden Jubilee would be the inauguration of a fund which would provide an annual income for helping the needy scholars of the school. If during the Jubilee year, a sum of $15,000 could be raised, $8,000 could be invested and the income derived therefrom devoted to the support of such scholars. A more Visible Jubilee Memorial could also be erected in the form of School Library and/or a Grandstand along one side of the playing field. Surely there can be no more fitting way for Old Boys and friends to join the School in com¬ memorating its Jubilee than by giving liberally to this fund and thereby helping in the great work for which the school stands, the educating and character-building of succeeding generations. Some time during September we hope to crown our efforts with a gala day for all those interested in the past, present and future welfare of the school. The success of our Jubilee depends upon the combined efforts of all Old Boys and Friends. Therefore remember, it all depends upon you. Kuching Badminton Association. The badminton season is now in full swing, and the game is becoming still more popular judging by the number of new courts which have sprung up recently. During the month a start was made with the friendly Inter-club games. Kong Go’s, The Brothers' and the Min Teck School Parties visited the Sarawak Club, and Sarawak Club players visited the Hollywood and The Brothers' Badmin¬ ton Parties. Entries for the Association's open tournament close on May 16th. The events to be staged comprise men's singles and doubles, women's singles and doubles, mixed doubles and inter- party. كوچيڠ بد مينتن اسوسيا شن فد ديواس اين نمفقڽ ايله سواة درفد موسيم اتو كتيک فرمينن بدمينتن يڠتله منونجوقكن دڠن جياڽ بركمباڠن,دان جيک دقصيركن دانتارا ببراف بيتاڠن هلامن٢ بدمينتن يڠترديري درسمنجق سديكيت ماس يڠلالو مک دافتله كيس ڽسقسيكن بݢيمان كماراءن فرماءينن بدمينتن اين ماكين يرتمبه٢ كسوبوران. سدڠ ددالم فرانتاراءن بولن يڠدجنجوڠي فرمولاءن رماين فرتنديڠن فرصحابتن تله دمولاکن دانتارا جمعة "اينتر-فرتي", "کوڠ","ذي براذس" دان"مين تيق سکول فرتيس" سياف يڠتله ملاواة كهلامن "ذي سراواق كلب" دان اهلي٢ فاسوقكن "ذ سراواق كلب" تله ممبالسكن لاواتن مريک دهلامن "هولي وود" دان "ذي براذس بد مينتن فر تيس ". فمبوكاءن فرسكتوان باكي مماسقكن كدالم جدوال فرجواڠن اكن دتوتف فد 16 مي, تيف٢ بيلاڠن فاسوقکن يڠدكتڠهكن كميدان فرجواڠن اين دمان تركندوڠ ددالمڽ ياءيت فيهق لاكي٢ يڠبرفڽوراڠ دان يڠبردوا فاسڠن, دمكين جوا فيهق فرمفوانيڠبرفڽوراڠ دان بردوا فاسڠن,دان ددالمڽ ترماسق جوا فرݢاولن جمعه فاسوقكن اينتر-فرتي يڠبرفا سڠ فاسڠن. Second Division News. MARCH . Eleven criminal and eight civil cases came before the Simanggang Courts during March. 239 out-patients were treated at Simanggang Government Dispensary during the month, and 132 N.A.B. injections performed. From the Simanggang bazaar two simple cases of diphtheria were brought to hospital for isolation; fortunately the infection has not spread. The last victim was the hospital tukang ayer, who, together with the other patients, soon recovered after receiving injections of the antitoxin. Taxes in the Simanggaug District are coming in well. On the 19th Penghulu Kalong of the Batang Ai tendered his resignation. which was accepted; he ceased to be Penghulu at the end of the month. For some time there have been complaints from the Dayaks in his district, and his work has been far from satisfactory. A new Penghulu will have to be elected. Seeds and cuttings from Kuching were planted at the experimental demonstration vegetable garden at Enteban, Skrang. early in the month; they were later reported to be doing well. Mr E. M. Selous, Acting Secretary for Chinese Affairs, arrived at Simanggang on the 5th. having meanwhile visited Pantu, where on the 3rd. he was present al the election of the Kapitan China. Hiew Phiaw. Mr. Scions visited Engkilili on the 6th, returning to Simanggang on the 7th. On the 9th he went to Betong. and returned again on the 11th. Two new smoke-houses were built behind Simanggang bazaar during the month. On March 5th Badin (Dayak) of Rumah Enchi- rong, Stengin, Lemanak, brought in a crocodile which he had shot at Lubok Engkramah, Lemanak river. The beast measured 14 feet and 4 inches On March 3rd Native Officer Abang Abu Talip and the troops arrived back from the Ulu, and reported having found an outlaw’s langkau in the Ulu Wo. patch Jeklan. This appeared to have been deserted for about two or three months, bnt had been in use for some considerable time. The outlaws had evidently left before Kudang's death, as there were no signs of a hasty evacuation, runny of the attaps having been taken away by the owners. In all probability the outlaws are still in that neighbourhood. A Dayak case which has been outstanding tor some considerable time and was to have been decided by diving, was finally settled more or less amicably at Lubok Antu on March 11th This case was between Penghulu Jimbun of Delok. and Ujai of Bui, and started over a dispute about lanuh saka. a piece of jungle set aside out of respect for an ancestor of Ujai's killed there in battle many years ago. A part of this jungle was said to have been farmed by Penghulu Jinibun. Ujai, in anger, gathered a force and went to these farms and caused some damage there in their owners’ absence. The case was eventually settled as follows :— P. Jimbun was fined one pikul for farming tanah sake and was ordered to pay pemali of one mungkul, one manok. and one duku. Ujai was fined for his offence, sigi alas mekang ($10) one jani, one duku. Tn the settlement of this ease, at which various tuai helped, Ngang of Bulo deserves special mention for his common sense, knowledge of adat and his fearlessness in speaking out. Two criminal cases were held in the Resident's Court, Betong, Mr. P. M. Adams presiding. In the first, Lading of Spak was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment for causing hurt, and in the second Stephen Panus of Buloh Antu was sen¬ tenced to two months for bigamy. Later Panus' sentence was commuted to one week’s imprison¬ ment and a fine of twenty-five dollars. At Betong Dispensary 171 out-patients were treated during March, and 54 N.A.B. injections were administered. The general health of the district was good. Weekly visits to the bazaar and Government quarters were made by the Dresser. The three Tuai Rumah who visited Kuching to interview His Highness the Rajah returned to Betong on the 5th. It is understood that their requests will be reconsidered when His Highness visits the Second Division next month. Dayaks have been informed that until further notice no cartridges will be sold to any person living above Nanga Spak, and that consequently arm tax will not he collected from that district. The rainfall during March was exceptionally heavy in the Saribas District; rivers were in flood and numerous rice farms were damaged. On the 25th aud 26th the Government compound and foot¬ ball field were flooded, an occurrence that has not been witnessed for many years. It is feared that considerable damage was incurred at the experi¬ mental vegetable garden, where over an acre, had been newly planted. However, in spite of the rains, reports on padi continue to be satisfactory, and a fair to good crop is expected throughout the district. The following are extracts from a report from the District Officer, Saribas ;— “On March 13th at 9.80 p.m. I proceeded down river in the Rita and after a brief call at Kampong Sila arrived at Pusa at 3.15 a.m. Leaving again at 4.30 a.m. I eventually arrived at Debak at 8 a.m. "Unfortunately as the outboard came along¬ side her propeller fell off. Malays and Dayaks were turned out and assisted by diving in relays continually for two days. The propeller was recovered on the evening of the 16th; in the meantime, though, the engineer had ingeniously constructed a propeller from used opium tubes. It must be recorded to his credit that this con¬ traption succeeded in propelling the boat at half speed. "On the 17th, accompanied by Abang Taha, Native Officer, I returned to Pusa and arrived in Betong at midday on the 19th. During this visit several cases were heard and information given to the public regarding Rubber Restriction. "On the 24th I accompanied the Resident, Second Division, on a visit to Gensurai Layar. We returned in the outboard the same day." Twelve vessels entering and twelve vessels cleared the port of Betong during the month. On two occasions Chinese launches ran aground off Nanga Paku. The Chuan Kim Aik was stranded for three days but was eventually towed off by the Bulan. The La Follette succeeded in getting off on the same tide, hut for a short period her condition was critical. A large number of passengers’ property was lost overboard. Third Division News MARCH. Thirty-three civil and sixty-one criminal cases came before the Sibu Courts during March. The total land revenue for the Third Division for February amounted to $8,092.88 as compared with $6,169.76 for the corresponding month of the pre¬ vious year. The collection for Sibu District for the month amounted to $5,673.60. Seventeen applications including three for build¬ ing were approved totalling 49.70 acres. Two hundred and forty-five deeds were registered. Registration fees and stamp duty amounted to $746.40. Mr. C. S. Sergei arrived from Kuching on the 4th, en route for the Ulu Rejang to carry out a trig reconnaisance. Mr. B. J. C. Spurway, Divisional Forest Officer, returned from Pelagus and Pala Wong on the 15th. having completed the survey of the boundaries of the Pelagus Protected Forest. It is regrettable to have to report that all the timber for the construction of the new hospital is being procured outside the Division, local mills being unable to supply timber of the species and standard required. The licensee working in Bukit Lima Reserve has ceased work temporarily owing to trouble with his labour. The Kanowit mill has commenced operations again, and is awaiting a supply of new logs which are reported to be on the wav down from the Kapit District. The Hua Seng mill operating in Rantau Panjang, Igan, took out a licence to log kapor in the Kapit District, as a result of the dislike of local labour to working the neigh¬ bouring swamp forest which carries excellent stands of meraka. The following arc the statistics for Sibu and Kanowit for the month :— Piling to the foundations of the new Sibu hospital is still in progress, and it is anticipated that it will be rather more than a month before this is completed. On March 2nd Mr. W. L. P. Sochon, Assistant Commissioner of Sarawak Constabulary, proceeded to Kut en route to Dalat, Oya, Mukah and Bulingian on inspection. On the 13th he returned from Mukah District by outboard motor via the Kut. On the 17th a case of chicken-pox was reported in one of the Police Barracks in Green Road, Sibu, the patient as well as other inmates occupying the barracks were isolated from 17th to 31st. The quarters were thoroughly disinfected and vaccina¬ tions performed on all children in all the barracks who were not previously vaccinated. No further eases occurred. Twenty-seven civil and thirty criminal cases came before the Lower Rejang Courts during March. Monthly sessions have been instituted at Sarikei for all civil eases in the Police and District Courts, the session to commence on the first Monday in each month. They are proving successful. There was no serious crime in the Lower Rejang District during March. Two Malays were arrested on the night of the 29th for attempting to smuggle a maias on board the s.s. Kampar, outward bound, and were released on $400 bail. Reports were received that much of the Dayak padi in the Lower Rejang has been spoiled by the depredations of wild pigs, which are exceptionally numerous this year. The Agricultural Assistant continued this examina¬ tion of rubber gardens at Sarikei, and left Daro and Matu on the 29th to examine the sago areas. A meeting of local pepper gardeners was called on March 27th to discuss methods of improving the yield and eliminating disease. The meeting was adjourned until April 1st. Sarikei Wharf spring fenders were three times damaged by shipping during the month, and duly repaired. Wharfingers were engaged for the wharves at both Sarikei and Binatang. The new godown at Binatang was completed early in the month, but the work was not found completely satisfactory. More earth-filling was added to replace sinking nf the original filling. Roads in Sarikei Municipal Area are in good condition, as is the Repok Road out to the 6th mile, the repairs being satisfactorily completed. Contracts were signed for clearing the Sarikei- Balat road and the Binatang-Kelepu road, both of which arc badly overgrown. Gravel was ordered for delivery at Sarikei bazaar, and at Jakar Police station. The prison vegetable-garden at Sarikei is doing well and is being extended to make room for further varieties. Visitors to Sarikei during the month included the Acting Government Secretary, the Secretary for Internal Affairs, the Acting Superintendent of Lands and Surveys, Messrs. Summers and Farrelly of the Land and Survey Department. Dr. A. D. Hutchison, Mr. Sochon, Mr. Roach of the Island Trading Co., Messrs. Cobbold and Colman of the Borneo Co., Mr. McNeice, and Mr. and Mrs. Merrill, American visitors. Several cases of assault and one of affray came before the Kapit Courts during March; these all occurred in the bazaar, and owing to the increasing frequency of this type of case it will be necessary to inflict severe penalties if any more occur. No serious crime, however, came to light during the month. Penghulus Sibat, Atan, Manok Manchal and Ugak visited Kapit during the month. On March 30th Penghulu Grinang with his bala of fifteen arrived back empty-handed at Kapit from his expedition in search of outlaws in the ulu Gat and Kanyan. Apparently they were captured by a Dutch expedition which had lost its way in Sarawak territory; on production of Grinang's letter of authority, and when the Dutch realized they were in Sarawak, Grinang and his bala were released, and were paid by the Dutch to show them the way- back to Dutch territory. The padi in the Mujong district is on the whole good and harvesting is almost finished. The reports show that padi in other districts is patchy. Very little rattan was exported from Kapil owing to the low price offered. Chop Lee Hua (37 parties) rafted to Sibu 395 logs. 110 logs remaining at Kapil. During the course of a trip to the ulu Mujong the District Officer, Kapit, received complaints from two "Punan Batu" regarding the Oyan Dayaks. Apparently only nine Punan Batu remain, five females and four males, and they are absolutely dependent on the small amount of ui letek in ulii Melinau for a livelihood. Until now Dayaks have only worked damar in the ulu Melinau, and Melinau Dayaks have appreciated that the wi should be left for the Punans, with whom they are friendly. Oyan Dayaks, however, on the pretence of working damar have attacked the wi letek; the District Officer is calling down these Oyan Dayaks, and it is hoped to arrange for the small amount of wi Ictek in ulu Melinau to be reserved for the Punan Batu, sole survivors of the tribe, who appear doomed to extinction. The Revd. Mother Clare of Dalat R.C. Mission was very ill during the mouth. Dresser Ho Ah Kiew went over from Mukah to treat her, and she is now reported to be getting better,—a wonderful recovery for an old lady of her age. Penghulu Ambun of Balingian has asked to be allowed to obtain a schoolmaster for some twenty prospective pupils whose parents wish to start a small school. Abang Mils, Native Officer, went to the S.O.L. camp at Penipah (by arrangement with Dr. Irving) as Penghulu Slan had informed the S.O.L. head Dayaks Unit his coolies (120 or so) would get no redress for butang and other domestic offences, as none of the coolies were properly married to their women. Penghulu Sian stated be was told to adopt this policy by a former District Officer. As I doubt whether this is so, I instructed Abang Mus to inform Penghulu Sian and the said head Dayak (Uchong) that the S.O.L. Dayaks should be treated in exactly the same way as any Dayak house and that they come under Penghulu Sian's jurisdiction. Dr. Irving agrees to this. The monthly meeting of Tua Kampongs was held at Mukah on March 16th. Some 150 Melanaus also attended. They were urged to plant new sago gardens, or to re-stock old existing gardens and were informed that free tenure is conditional on the land being fully planted up. (Very few new gardens have been opened up recently, and many are only sparsely planted). Arrangements have also been made to inform natives of the prices of sago weekly, us at present they are receiving prices very much below the correct market prices. Such prices will (from March 1st) be recorded on a sago graph, so that the Courts will have an indication of the price at any¬ time after this date, when settling debt cases. Those present were informed of this and urged to sell in the best market. Juragan Bakar bin Suleiman reported that his handling, the Sri Titian, was wrecked off Igan and blown ashore as a total loss about March 10th. The owner, who was aboard, agreed that this accident was nobody’s fault. No lives were lost. Twenty -eight vessels cleared from Mukah during tile month totalling 1,057 tons. The Chong Boon School al Mukah was visited by the District Officer during the month. The head¬ master stated that Malay is taught for two one-hour periods weekly. The. pupils, on being questioned by the Senior Native Officer, Pengiran Haji Mohamat, who was present, were either too frightened to talk or knew but little Malay, a knowledge of which is a condition of the grant. Otherwise the school appears to be an excellent one. On March 29th it was reported at Dalat that a Melanau youth named Wat bin Aso had attempted to commit suicide by cutting his throat. He has been sent to Sibu for medical attention and observation. Apart from this, no serious crime was reported in the Oya and Dalat District during the month. The Mukah dresser paid his usual routine visit to Oya and Dalat during the month. The bazaars and Government quarters were inspected and found to be clean and in order. The general health of the District was satisfactory. On March 25th the Divisional Medical Officer, Dr. A. D. Hutchison, arrived at Oya in the m.1. Chamois. During his trip Dalat was visited, and the proposed temporary quarters for the new dresser and the temporary accommodation for the dispensary were inspected. The District Officer accompanied the Divisional Medical Officer to Mukah on 28th in order to discuss the transfer of certain drugs from Mukah to Dalat. The m.l. Chamois was held up in Oya on 27th as the weather was loo rough for her to put to sea. The District Officer, Oya and Dalat, reports that Wan Hussein, Native Officer, travelled the whole of Penghulu Dagang’s district from March 16th to 29th and visited all houses. A certain amount of door tax, fines and gun tax was collected. In each house the names of the tuai bilek were taken, and also the names of the owners of shot-guns in order that the Registers might be checked. The policy of Government concerning the issue of cartridges was explained, as also was the position as regards the outlaws still at large. The importance of the tongkat system of com¬ munication was impressed upon all Tuai Rumah, and the recent Orders concerning rubber tapping, the manufacture of scrap rubber, and the hours during which rubber may be tapped were all explained. There was strangely little grumbling, but Dayaks are not pleased with the Order prohibit¬ ing tuba fishing in spite of the fact that the benefits to be gained by its total abolition have been explained time and again. Melanau fishing was again at a standstill during the month owing to rough weather. Wan Hussein, Native Officer, reports that the padi crop in the ulu this year is again an almost com¬ plete failure. Up to some two months ago high hopes were entertained for a good crop, but ruts and mice have caused terriffic havoc since then. The most fortunate houses have sufficient padi to last for three or four months, and the most unfortunate sufficient for anything up to a maximum of a month. This is what the Dayaks themselves say, so it is probably a pessimistic estimate. Notices in connection with the manufacture and export of scrap rubber, the forthcoming tapping holiday, and the hours during which it is permitted to tap rubber, wore issued throughout the Oya and Dalat district, and steps were taken to inform all heads of communities. The repairs to the Penat bridge were, completed during the mouth. A good job has been done. A new store was built for the Oya lighthouse and the lighthouse keeper's quarters were repaired. The large bridge on the Room Road at. Oya was repaired, and owing to rotten state of the timber this amounted almost to rebuilding. Six schooners and four motor launches cleared Oya during the month, the total tonnage being 303 tons. On March 3rd ten collecting boxes for the Mosque Fund were distributed nt Ova to the heads of the Mohamedan community. These boxes are scaled and are fitted with a strip of spring in order to foil any attempt to get donations out of the box once they are in it. The boxes were still in circulation at the end of the month, and the result of collections is not yet known. On March 29th a talking cinema was opened at Oya. It had been operating at Dalat previously, but wlien the proprietor decided to move on it was learnt that he did not intend to visit Oya. Certain local towkays and others therefore subscribed a sum of fifty dollars and hired the cinema for three nights. The machine and screen were erected in the middle of the street in Ova Bazaar, and the show for the throe nights was free to all who wished to come. The whole show was a thorough success; the pictures were excellent and the crowds phenomenal. Most of those present had never seen a moving picture before, and the way they continued to come on the. second and third nights is sufficient evidence of their appreciation of the show. On the last night, the 31st, the crowds stretched from the Kapitan China's shophouse to the Chinese, school on both sides of the screen, as it had been learnt that the show could be seen just as well from the back of the screen as the front. It is noteworthy that Ova has possibly never seen a crowd before such as that on this night; there must have been at least five hundred people present. The pictures shown included Shanghai Express, Airmail, and Tom Mix in Flaming Guns. On March 29th a fire occurred in the Chinese Cemetery which is situated close to the Bazaar. The fire was extinguished and no damage was done. At an. inquiry held on 31st no evidence of incendiarism was disclosed. Opening of the Sibu Foochow Commercial Recreation Club. The Foochow Community in the Rejang river made a must progressive step when a new Club styled the Sibu Foochow Commercial Recreation Club was opened by Mr. C. D. Adams,’Resident, Third Division, on the afternoon of March 26th. The officials and members of the club, European residents who had been invited to attend the cere¬ mony, and quite a large crowd of other onlookers were gathered in front of the new club premises when the Resident arrived at 4 p.m. Mr. Adams made a short speech congratulating the enterprise before cutting the green ribbon stretched across Ilie main entrance, and declaring the club open. The club at present occupies the middle floor of the last house at the down-river end of the block in Island Road opposite the Methodist Church. It is understood that in time the club wish to acquire the whole building. The premises are extremely well furnished, especially the bed¬ rooms provided for the use of outstation members and visitors to Sibu. After the opening ceremony the Chairman, Mr. Yu Sut Moi, asked the guests to christen the club in the usual manner. The Resident proposed success and prosperity to the club and the toast was given almost musical honours. The Chairman replied in Foochow his speech being interpreted. A photograph was then taken outside the club. The proceedings wound up with an excellent dinner served in the main room of the club at 7 p.m.—(Contributed.) Fourth Division News. MAUCH, 1936. His Highness the Rajah arrived in Miri on the last day of March, and made an official landing at 3 p.m. His Highness was accompanied by Dayang Valerie mid Mrs. C. D. Adams. A guard of honour was furnished by the Sarawak Constabulary under the command of Mr. I). V. Murphy. Leading natives and Chinese met Bis Highness on the wharf. Mr. 11. B. Wilmot. Trade Commissioner, Singa¬ pore, arrived in Miri from Kuala Beloit on March 19th. and left for Kuching the next day. Mr. T. A. Reid of tlie Public. Works Department was in Miri from March Will until the 27th, making a report on the Miri Government buildings and public works generally. The slate of the Govern¬ ment offices makes it clear that something will have to be done soon. Mr. E. Banks, Curator of the Sarawak Museum, arrived in Miri on the 17lli and left a few days later for the upper walers of the Baram River where, it is understood, he pnqxwes to enquire further into the rumours of a last civilisation there. Padi reports throughout the Fourth Division aro satisfactory, and in some cases good, except from Baram. One sympathises with the people there, but it would be interesting to know why the rats and mice there are alleged to be worse than in other districts. Last year Government distributed $1,500 in relief, and this year provision has been made for $5,000. This cannot go on, and it will be necessary to find out whether these failures are unavoidable, or whether they are the result of laziness. Very few natives came down to Limbang during March as they were all busy finishing their harvests. This was mostly completed by the end of the month by Dayaks, Muruts and Bisayahs. There is still a small amount of swamp padi to be collected by Malays. The padi crops throughout the Limbang district have been above the average. The following is a rough guide for the district :- (a) Kelabits in (he Medihit, Ulu Limbang, started well, but pests interfered, and very little padi was gathered although they have a very abundant catch-crop of krebang. (b) The Skrang Dayak reserve up to Sungei Ladong has a bumper crop except for a few doors who commenced too early; these were fair crops only. (c) Penghulu Belulok and his Muruts have bumper crops except for a few who were too lazy to plant and protect their farms sufficiently. (d) Bisayahs and Kadayans. Good average crops. (e) Dayaks and Tagals in Lnbai fair only owing to very bad land. (f) Malays. Good average crops. The harvest as a whole can be considered very successful. Mr. J. R. Outram, Passed Cadet, accompanied by Abang Hamdan, Native Officer, visited Rangau and the down-river kampongs from March 4th to 6th. On March 7th Mr. Maclaren of Batu Apoi brought over a combined Temburong and Batu Apoi football team to compete against Limbang. Much to every¬ one’s surprise, Limbang won 3-0. The visitors were entertained in the club in the evening. The following day they sailed for Brunei, where they played the Police and Customs team. The District Officer visited the Dayaks in the Sebiew, Silas and Benai Rivers during March. The prospect for the padi harvest is as bad in these districts as everywhere else, and a shortage of padi amongst the Dayaks and Malays is generally certain. A Malay coolie named Seman bin Sukor fell from a coconut tree in the Bintulu Government compound and died in hospital six hours later. He was employed at the time of hie fall in fixing attaps to a clerk's quarters. The Dresser-in-Charge of Baram hospital had an accident whilst opening a bottle of ammonia and damaged an eye. Under personal treatment it did not become any easier, so he was sent to Miri on the 13th, and returned a few days later. The District Officer, Baram, reports that towards the end of the month the Penghulus and many headmen arrived down preparatory to meeting His Highness the Rajah early in April. In every case the reports of the harvest were bad, and many have no seed with which to plant the new crops. There is little hope of obtaining immediate repay¬ ment for the assistance given last year, and it is certain that further help will be required in a few months. The causes are due almost entirely to rats and mice, of which there have been an unpre¬ cedented number. In view of this shortage of food, it had been intended to postpone the Baram Regatta until next year or until such time as the harvest was sufficient, but, before the matter could be discussed, the chiefs themselves asked that no Regatta should be held. This means that the Kelabits can be visited after all. Visits were paid by Mohamed Zin Galau to Long Lama and Beluru in connection with the reports made last month of deaths by crocodiles; Inquests were held and the stories, as reported, were found to be correct. Verdicts of death by misadventure were returned in both cases. The crocodiles were killed and the bodies of the deceased recovered. Samat, the Bakong headman, lost over a hundred pasu of newly-harvested rice in a fire that destroyed his farming hut near Beluru. A party of eight Kayans who were in Miri for medical treatment became stranded for lack of funds, and had to be sent back at Government expense. They were kept in Marudi until their debts had been paid, and were reprimanded. They had had suffi¬ cient cash when they departed, but the lure of the shops was too enticing, and it all vanished in un¬ necessary expenditure. Kampong Narum was paid an official visit for the first time in many years. It is an old custom that these people should be visited once every three months, and in future it will be done. The attendance at the Baram Vernacular school had dropped to a very low figure, and it became necessary for the District Officer to address a few words to a meeting of parents and boys. After a few days the attendance was more than doubled, and should be trebled in a week or so. Mr. H. P. Buxton, Assistant Forest Officer, arrived at Baram on the 17th, and proceeded Up river the next day. He is continuing his work on the Linai Protected Forest and will also do a survey of the Tutoh river. The Curator of the Sarawak Museum arrived on the 20th, and departed for the Kelabit country four days later by way of the Selungan river. He is expected to be away several months. The Assistant District Officer, Lawas and Trusan. records with regret the death on March 10th of Matassan bin Drahman, who had been Tua Kam¬ pong of Kampong Barn, Sundar, for the past fifteen years. His successor has not yet been chosen. During the month the Assistant District Officer paid a visit to Ulu Trusan and Kelalan Bah, return¬ ing to Lawas on March 20th. Nothing of interest occurred during his absence, most of the natives being busy harvesting padi. The crops generally are fair, but a certain amount of damage has been caused by rats and mice. A shortage, however, is unlikely. The Lawas (Sarawak) Estates, Ltd., exported 21,022 lbs. of dry rubber during the month. The following are extracts from a report by Mr. H. E. Cutfield, District Officer, Limbang and Lawas, on a visit to the Kelabits in the Ulu Medihit:— "I left Limbang by m.l. Sylvia on March 20th, 1936, accompanied by Mr. J. K. Outram and Up¬ river Agent Jaya. Ukong, where a short call was made, was reached at 1 p.m. and Sungei Prangga about 3 p.m. Here the launch was left and we boated up to R. Sandom at Tanah Merab, where the night was spent. "Penghulu Belulok was living in the house of a new wife he has recently married, and he arrived that evening. Kedoh, a brother-in-law of T. R. Sandom, accompanied the party the next day. and we were also joined by Penghulu Belulok and two followers. Calls were made at Rumah Brandah and Rumah Kedu. T.K. Kedu and one follower also joined the party, but Tama- nok Weaw being still busy with his harvest did not accompany us. Rumah Gani at N. Sepapit was reached at dusk where the night was spent. Most of the Skrang Dayak houses were repre¬ sented at Rumah Gani that night, and many things were discussed. "The following morning we examined Gani's pepper gardens; about 500 vines have been planted by this house, and look very promising. Mr. Outram returned down-river to Limbang, while I proceeded up-river with two boats. The night was spent on a gravel-bed near Sungei Entaba. "We left again up-river the next morning and should have reached the house at N. Medihit, but owing to the slight increase in flood caused by rain the previous evening we were short of this and spent the night on another gravel-bed, about one hour below N. Medihit. Thers is no habita¬ tion between Rumah Gani and the house near the mouth of the Medihit, which are two good days apart, although there are about ten wandering Punans somewhere in the Ulu of one of the side streams. We tried to get in touch with these • people, but without success. It is lovely country but not very much good for fanning, as the hills are too steep near the river, and the banks are mostly formed by steep rugged cliffs rising sheer out of the river. For practically the whole of the second day the journey was through a steep rocky gorge with a number of side streams joining the main river in waterfalls or cascades, and with the virgin jungle above these cliffs it is remark¬ ably pretty, but, as stated, it is poor farming land. "The following morning we were under way early and reached the Murut-Kelabit house of Batang Arau about 7.30 a.m. The boats were left here, and we started again on foot up the Medihit at about 9 a.m. Mr. Davidson’s house was reached after one hour's walk. This station of the Borneo Evangelical Mission is at the Peng- kalan for Tama Kuling's bouse, which is situated about 800 to 1,000 feet up and was reached after about one hour’s walk from the Pengkalan. Mr. and Mrs. Davidson were both present, but the former had been laid up for the last four days with fever. We remained at Mr. Davidson’s house, where I gratefully accepted an invitation to luncheon, until about 3 p.m., and then walked on to Tama Kuling’s house. Tama Ruling, who is recognized as the head of the Kelabits in this District, has been endeavouring to build a new house for the last eighteen months or two years, but owing to various members of his following seeing snakes and other bad omens and making this an excuse for laziness, nothing is ever done. The present house is leaning over at a perilous angle and is only held up by additional tongkats and rattan hawsers tied to tree-slumps in the hill behind. The house and its inmates are incredibly dirty, but the view from the house is magnificent, and its altitude makes it very cool at night. "Tama Ruling is recognized by the Relabits as their head, presumably owing to asal, but he is not impressive, and Balang Imat gives one the impression of having more authority and intel¬ ligence. It was originally intended to go no further than lama Ruling's house, but to spend two nights there and call all other houses there for an aum on the second night; this is what lias usually been done on previous occasions. I altered this programme, however, and decided to spend only one night there and then go on to Balang Imat's new house of 15 doors, which is about three hours' walk further up the Medihit. The meeting of people from all other houses was therefore arranged to take place there. Little business could be undertaken in Ruling’s house, anyhow, since they were already in an advanced state of alcoholic excitement by the time I arrived, and the consumption of burak and tuak continued throughout the night. "The following morning we left Rumah Tama Ruling followed by practically the whole house, in spite of the fact that most of them were suffering from alcoholic remorse. The path from here leads up through their farm and on to a ridge about 2,000 feet up; this ridge is followed the whole way until it drops down to Balang Imat's house. This, like all Kelabit houses, is high up and situated about 1,000 to 1,200 feet above sea level, and commands an excellent view. Tn one direction one looks over towards the Ulu Tutoh, patch Barra, and in the other to the watershed between the Ulu Trusan and Ulu Limbang. This house of 15 doors is newly built, and is excellent judged by ordinary Relabit standards. People from all the Kelabit houses were present that night. These were Tama Ruling, Balang Imat, Batang Maran, Balang Arau anil Tama Kalang. No jars were allowed to be opened or drink consumed until business had been completed, with the result that sen¬ sible conversation was possible and several matters were discussed. All the Relabits unanimously elected Penghulu Belulok to be their Penghulu instead of Penghulu Tamanok Weaw who is supposed to be in charge of them. All the Kelabit houses had poor crops owing to pests, but they have a very substantial catch crop in the form of krebang which is extensively planted all over their padi-fields. Much of this, though, unfortunately is turned into burak. as is most of their padi. "The following is a typical example of the mentality of these people. Soon after my arrival at Rumah Balang Imat I received a note from Mr. Davidson saying that he had received an urgent call to attend a sick child at Balang Imat's house. He prepared to follow me, but as he could not find anyone to carry his bag. and be was only just out of bed after four days’ fever, he did not think he could undertake the long walk. He mentioned that it was difficult to make out what was wrong with the child from the messenger’s description, but he gathered that it was suffering from lack of nourishment; he therefore sent a tin of condensed milk, some small doses of quinine (made up for a child) and a weak solution of stomach mixture. I went and examined the child, which looked anaemic, and found that its mother was dead. I enquired what they were feeding it on, and to my surprise they replied—'burak'. I asked if they were not giving it rice or bubor or krebang, but they replied ’No. only burak’-. The child certainly did not seem to take to the milk so well as to the stronger beverage. I wonder how long an infant could last on a diet of gin only? ‘‘Regulations against tuba-fishing and many other subjects were explained All tax from every house for 1936 was paid in full. This, I should think, is a record, since these people usually only pay once every two or three years and are always behind with their payment. Two petty cases were settled, and eventually the jars were allowed to be uncorked. "The following day we left down the Medihit by boats. The Mission was reached about 11.30. and after a short stay there to pick up their mail we left for the month and collected our down¬ river boats. The night was spent on a gravel-bed near N. Bilong in the Limbang. It rained during the evening and night with the result that a rise in the river assisted us next day. and Sprunga was reached at 6.30 p.m. M.L. Sylvia had arrived during the day. and the night was spent on board. "We left Spranga at daylight on March 28th, called at Ukong and Limpasong. and reached Tumbling at 11.30 a.m.” Miri Cricket Visit, 1936. SUCCESS OF KUCHING TEAM. On Wednesday April 8th, an expectant and happy band of cricketers set sail for Miri on the rn.v. Mar¬ garet. Fortunately for the well-being of the side the weather, apart from a spell of heavy rolling on Wednesday night, stayed fine, and Miri was reached at 1.31) a.m. on Friday. The journey, considering the varied cramped quarters, was more comfortable than had been expected. In the prevailing flat calm the Miri bar presented no terrors, and the party were all ashore by 8.30 a.m. Several of the team seized the opportunity on Friday morning to have a round of golf, and the Miri course was much admired by all who played over it. Net practice was held that evening. It was interrupted by a relay race in the swimming pool in which Taylor, Mitchell, Benson and Digby defeated a selected Miri four over a four "lengths” course by about six feet. Taylor started off by giving Kuching a lead that the remaining three stuck to manfully. Next morning—no one being late—at least, very late, the match started and Kuching having wan the toss Taylor judiciously put Miri in to bat. The opening pair played some rather steady bowling with confidence, if with but little result, but the first changes although they brought runs also collected some rather valuable wickets, and when Gascoigne came on again with the score at 56 the last five wickets fell for 15 runs. If Kuching’s ground fielding was not impeccable, their catching WHS. aud only one rather hard chance was missed. Reid in the slips held three excellent catches, two of these being particularly well taken, and in addition caught and bowled Blatchcr before, fortunately, be bad had lime to settle down. Gascoigne bowled well, and every bowler, except¬ ing Benson, got a wicket. Mitchell put down the best ball of the innings to beat Price. Kitching opened confidently, and passed Miri’s total with one wicket down. The hundred was hoisted with only two wickets down, but then a collapse set in till Gascoigne and Kitto got together. Kuching were on the whole rather lucky over dropped catches, nevertheless this should not be considered a reflection on a truly magnificent innings by Digby, who after having given a couple of early chances, presented a bat to the bowling that must have looked the size of a bam door to the Miri side. He hit five 4's and three 3's. Selous, who does not believe in running singles during the heat of the day concentrated on boun¬ daries and had eight fours in his score of 35, and was out trying to turn yet another hall to the leg boundary. Gascoigne coming in late, after Miri had fielded most of the extremely hot afternoon, and getting bis due share of good fortune, swung his bat like a mashie and apparently remembered to keep his eye on the ball. The Miri bowling remained steady to the end, but the field gave it poor support. Trechman bowled better than his figures would represeut. It was unfortunate that an injury prevented King from bowling in bis true style. Miri going in to bat again at 5 o’clock after having been in the field for about 4 hours, suffered such a series of shocks from Benson that in five overs, five wickets had fallen for seven runs. At this lime Benson's analysis read—overs 3, maidens I runs 4, wickets 5; stumps were drawn, as arranged, at 5.30 p.m. which coincided with the fall of the 5th wicket; this was as well, for the light, which had been rather queer during most of Miri’s second innings, was becoming very difficult. Miri’s misfortune continued next morning, Gas¬ coigne carrying on where Benson left off. and in twenty-five minutes the remaining wickets fell for twenty runs. The 9th wicket men were Price, who hail made 8, mid Eagle who with 10 had made top score in the ‘2nd innings (and was obviously enjoying him¬ self when he pulled across a ball that came in from the off and was out. King who followed him in (and who unfortunately had not been very fit) only lasted three halls and the match was over. Both Benson and Gascoigne returned amazing figures for this innings, and over the whole game the. latter had the remarkable record of 8 wickets for 15 runs. It will be noticed that- at one time Miri bad lost eight wickets for 9 runs in this innings. To sum up it was a game in which right from winning the toss everything went right for Kuching and wrong for the home side. Kuching's deadly catching did more than anything else to win the match, only one difficult catch being put on the ground during Miri's two innings. The ground fielding, too, was clean, and the hacking-up very good. In short Kuching looked like a team of cricketers in the field. No sooner had the cricketers sunk some very welcome beer, when seven of them were called on to play water polo. The referee and the time¬ keepers made things as easy as they could for Kuching, who in spite of the fact that five of them were novices at the game, and in spite of "Tiger" Morton's determined efforts, rather surprisingly- won by two goals to one. Here tribute should be paid to Calvert's goal¬ keeping and Digby’s and Taylor's indefatigable swimming. On Sunday April the 12th the Kuching cricket team played Miri at hockey. Kuching fielded ten men and were granted the services of an Asiatic goal-keeper, and Miri fielded a full European side. The game opened at an exceptionally fast pace, which was maintained throughout, chiefly because the ground was in perfect condition. For the first 20 mintues play was even and in midfield, then Miri presscd and from a melée in front of goal, Irving scored. Kuching replied with a good passing movement but failed to score. After half time both sides pressed repeatedly and on more than one occasion Kuching had bad luck in not scoring. C. Chater, Miri's goalkeeper, played very well nt this period and saved several hard shots by Kuching forwards, that seemed certain goals. Miri too were unable to score, their passing movements being repeatedly foiled by Reid and Digby's inter¬ ception, both of whom played excellently throughout. Hughes-Hallett for Miri and Mitchell for Kuching both played a strong game. Considering the inex¬ perience of several members of the Kuching team, they put up a very creditable performance in only losing by one goal to none. We take this opportunity of thanking Miri for a most enjoyable game on a really good ground. . Next morning our hosts, having to return to work, left us more or less to our own devices, but in the evening a golf game was arranged. Our hosts showed consideration by fielding a side as nearly equal on handicaps as they could, and deservedly won by three matches to nil, with two games halved. Gascoigne and Elam halved their matches, the latter putting up an especially good show and Mitchell, Taylor and Outram, now con¬ verted to a "Kuching-ite," all lost. It was a great pleasure and a refreshing change to putt on greens where it was "odds on" that correctly hit putts would go down and to see fair¬ ways where a bad lie was the exception rather than the rule. The writer, as no doubt do the other Kuching golfers, looks forward to having many more rounds over Miri course in the future, and in the mean¬ time looks back on his visit with the knowledge that no hosts could have been more kindly, for¬ bearing, and hospitable than those of Miri in 1936. We were treated like Kings with true Eastern Hospitality, and it is hoped that next year we shall be able to welcome a Miri ride in Kuching and give them as enjoyable a lime as was given us. CORRESPONDENCE. [The Editor is not responsible for the opinions of correspondents.] Rubber Restriction. The Editor, . SIR, In the April issue of The I notice that rubber statistics were given for the first two months of 193G, showing that 4,128 tons were exported instead of the 3,000 tons allowed by the quota. I notice further that rubber dealers' stocks had been reduced by 538 tons showing that merchants had sold off their supplies during the tupping holiday. To reduce the amount of rubber exports to the permissible amount, an order was suddenly given lust month which prohibited the further export of bark scrap rubber, an order that has raised much protest from the majority of owners of large mid small rubber plantations, rubber dealers, rubber millers and others interested in the industry. There are in Sarawak some 70,000 to 80,000 rubber gardens, most of them small, some even very small. Including Sungei Tengah, Sungei Moyan, Dahan, Samarahan, Lawas and a very considerable number of quite large Chinese owned estates, the average size of each holding is under three acres. All these holdings produce sheet rubber of varying qualities and scrap bark rubber, and the proportions of each may be taken approximately as 90% of sheet and 10% of scrap, the main point to remember being that to get sheet there must be bark scrap. The report from the Third Division shows that scrap forms 16% of the total amount exported, which means either that the trees are very badly tapped, or else that very bad sheet is produced; this in all likelihood takes place on a number of the small Dayak gardens. This badly-made sheet is milled and exported from Sarawak as Scrap, bill in F.M.S. it is not known as scrap but has a class of its own. In any case both the scrap and the badly-made sheet, when it is milled, are of considerable value, the present price being about £55 per ton compared with £60 per ton for good quality sheet. The export duty and cess on scrap rubber being the same as on sheet, it makes no difference to the revenue of the country which is exported. To those small producers therefore who have not the means, nor, perhaps, the skill, to make good diamond sheet, the embargo on scrap and what is known here, but not elsewhere, as scrap, must he a very great hardship. Having in the past two years, with the exception of a few months in 1934, been able to make a quite comfortable livelihood from these commodities, one can imagine what their feelings must be when they are told that in future they cannot be sold, and their means of liveli¬ hood is gone. Take the case of numbers of other small pro¬ ducers, more skilful perhaps, but still with very small holdings. Will they willingly lose their 10% scrap earnings? They will most probably overtap to get sufficient rubber to make up for its loss, thus shortening the life of their rubber trees. In the early days of the rubber industry, when rubber was at $6 per catty, the daily task for a tapper was 200 trees; a slump followed, and in order to make a living wage, the coolie had to increase this number and tap another 50 daily; then more pros¬ perous times came, and the owner of the plantation, wishing to make up for the lean years, urged his coolies to again increase the number of trees tapped, offering him higher wages as an inducement. Whether there has been a slump or a boom the daily task has increased, and now a coolie can tap 450 to 500 trees daily and will still manage to add to this number. Referring again to the excess of 1,428 tons of rubber during January and February, it is very- evident that the embargo on scrap rubber will not solve the problem of reducing the exports to the permissible quantity, considering that scrap only forms 10% of the total export and an excess of 1,428 tons means an excess of 47%. It is the considered opinion of the majority of those who have seriously thought over the question that the only solution is the compulsory stopping of tapping. The rubber producers would prefer weekly tapping holidays but this scheme was thought to be imprac¬ ticable in this country. Where there are so many very small gardens, many of them difficult of access, it was thought that the labour and expense of supervision involved would be too great. Whether it is really impracticable or not is a moot point, but it is not the purpose of this article to discuss this question. Towards the end of 1934, after very careful con¬ sideration as to what was to be the most effectual and the most just method of restricting rubber supplies, a three weeks' tapping holiday every quarter was instituted, an institution which equalized the hardships, for everyone concerned in the rubber industry. This three weeks holiday has proved to be too short, but that should not be a difficult matter to adjust without dislocating the whole industry; no further expense would be incurred, the present organization for enforcing the order being suffi¬ cient. Now that it has been decreed that no more scrap is to be exported, a eery serious question arises. What is to be done with it? Is it to be allowed to lie on the ground and become one of the happiest of hunting grounds for white ants, which having enjoyed the scrap will next attack the trees? Thia is a very great danger to all plantations almost sufficient in itself to prove that forbidding the collection of scrap is not a method to be employed in restricting rubber. Again, there is the case of the rubber millers, a small class certainly, but surely with a right to be considered. Thousands of pounds have been spent on buildings and fitting up their factories with machinery which is of no use for any purpose beyond rubber milling. These millers employ skilled men as well as coolies, the coolies must and will be dismissed,— incidentally many mean to go rubber tap¬ ping.—but what is to happen to the skilled men? Their employers can afford neither to let them go nor to keep them. Meanwhile, rent, assessment, upkeep of build¬ ings and machinery, and in some eases interest on borrowed capital must all be paid, and if the machinery forms the security for the loan then it is of very little value. A stoppage of one day’s tapping means a daily reduction of 134 tons of rubber. Would not an extension of tapping holidays, as many as were necessary, meet the difficulty of restricting supplies ? With rubber at over 30 cents per catty a con¬ siderable extension of the number of these holidays would still leave everyone concerned in a much better plight than they were 2 years ago. The hardship would fall equally on everyone. The owners of the smallest and most primitively worked gardens would be able to market their produce. The bark on the trees on all gardens would be conserved. There would be no danger from white ants. A yearly asset to the country of £99,000 would not be thrown to waste. All would feel that although profits might be less, may be considerably less, yet no one had any cause to feel unjustly treated. 1 am. etc. 28th April, 1936. INTERESTED. Antimony in Sarawak. KUCHING, 22nd April, 1936. The Editor, , Kuching. SIR, In the last issue of the Gazette you publish an article on "Antimony in Sarawak." This article, which has the appearance of being compiled from text-books or technical magazine monographs, contains several inaccuracies which the author, I think, is guilty of through a too superficial Study of his subject. "Antimony in Sarawak." Firstly, in spite of fairly intensive inquiry and prospecting there is at present no indication that "nature has stored up antimony in lavish, abun¬ dance.” , , , For a number of years during the last century Sarawak exported large quantities of antimony both metal and ore, the ore being mined chiefly in the Districts of Bau and Baku. Small shipments were made from Baram river. Since 1912, however, payable ore m these districts has become very scarce, and though there are numerous small deposits to be found, they are patchy or so low grade that they do not pay to work. Reports of deposits have been heard of from the Rejang but are also stated to be very low grade. The statement also that "The occurrence of antimony oxide as an outcrop is a never-failing indication of a vein or lode of antimony sulphide deeper down" is not accurate when applied to antimony deposits in thia country. The nearest approach to lodes are narrow "stringers” of antimony running through faults in the limestone, usually of such low value that they do not pay to blast out. Secondly, the author has, probably unwittingly, quoted prices for antimony which are definitely mis¬ leading and may cause suspicions of "profiteering” on the part of those at present buying for export. The present price of antimony regulus (the smelted ore) in London is about. £70 per ton (say $35 per picul). The price of antimony sulphide (the ore shipped from Sarawak) is from £10 - £15 per ton, $5 - $7 per picul depending on the assays of the ore. Antimony sulphide is bought by European, Japanese aud American buyers on the metallic content of the ore and nothing under 40% is accepted. The prices paid vary from time to time and run between 4/6d to 4/- for each unit (1%) of metal in the ore. Tims an ore assaying 50% metal would fetch around $125 per ton with the price at $2.50 per unit. Buyers are reluctant to accept parcels of less than 25 tons owing to assay costs, etc. To get a shipment of even this small amount is difficult nowadays in Sarawak and driblets from various sources of supply are required to make up a consignment. The result is that while a certain proportion of each lot will probably assay up to 65% sulphide the general assay of the parcel will very likely not be more than 60%, equal to 42% metal. Another risk shippers have to run is arsenic, usually associated with the metal. A shipment running more than 0.05% arsenic will be rejected. Present prices paid for antimony sulphide in Sarawak are $2.75 to $3.50 per picul for No. 1, buyers in addition paying for bags, transport charges and royalties to mines and garden owners. It is impossible to assay each little lot, so the ore is graded No. 1 and No. ‘2. Both miner and buyer's agent are excellent judges of the values and while the buyers very often find stuff bought as No. 1 does not pass muster when assayed, there is very seldom a dispute about the prices. The antimony buyer having bought a parcel at the above figure would receive $7.50 per picul for il if the assay was say 50% metal. Freight, duty, handling charges would amount to $3.50 per picul, in addition to his buying price, leaving a nett of 50 cents per picul with all the risks attendant to arsenic, disputed assays in London and claims for short weights. These figures show that "the situation of discord" is not so pregnant with "cause for complaint as the author thinks. The author’s interesting facts about antimony in Hunan will not, I trust, encourage undue optimism of Sarawak competing with China or Mexico as one of the prin¬ cipal sources of supply of the metal. From what I have heard of antimony in China, it seems to occur in very large deposits and is very high grade With sufficiently large supplies of ore, it is an easy matter, with a Government Department holding an interest, to erect smelting plant, control output and to a certain extent influence market prices. Just how much the enhanced value of the metal benefits the actual producers, we are not informed,but it may be assumed that the author’s "profitable quotations at which exporters sell to metal merchants in Europe and Japan" are not unknown to China. The penultimate paragraph of the article dealing with the future of the "minor metals" conveys an impression that there has been a slight confusion between antimony and aluminium. Yours faithfully, "STIBNITE.” Rugby League in Kuching. SIMANGGANG, 22nd April, 1936. SIR, Reference the suggestion in the Local news column of the of April 1st, that we may one day see a Rugby League in Kuching, may I put up the other point of view, that we hope we will not. There is much to support the statement that leagues and competitions are the ruin of the sporting side of many games. The feeling over "bodyline bowling" was very probably intensified by the fact that the matches have become too much of an international com¬ petition. The stiffening of rules in Soccer that would have been unnecessary in friendly games are the outcome of leagues rather than professionalism. Indeed, we do not need to look further than Kuching to remember some painful results of com¬ petitions in the Soccer game. I trust that Rugby will be able to make itself popular without the doubtful stimulus of a league or a competition. Yours respectfully, N. MACE. Shorts for Women. 26th April, 1936. To The Editor, The . DEAR SIR, It was good to see in your February issue the article from the Straits Times on the subject of women wearing shorts, which, though excellent as far as it goes, does not seem to me to go far enough; after a good many years in the East, I should go further and say that under no circumstances what¬ ever should women wear shorts this side of Suez, il is bad enough on the other hut anathema on this— Anyway, is not womens’ clothing scanty enough, without going any further, and it is difficult to understand this execrable craze for dressing like men, looking ridiculous, and losing the finer attri¬ butes of woman. The writer of the article above-mentioned seems to think that shorts can be worn at tennis parties, sports, etc., evidently not realizing that at all these functions out here there are Chinese or Malay servants about : and that these servants when they see their friends or relatives later will certainly relate about the “menu" dressed like china becha or add even more derogatory remarks. It is the writer's hope that this (I cannot call it anything else) sloppy dress for women will find no favour here, for the reason that as a European it is very unpleasant to think that our women are decried and put down as low class, because that is what happens—and further it is up to ns if we still wish to retain the respect of the people of the country (and much of which, it is to be regretted, has been lost) not to do anything likely to lessen it. . Perhaps whilst on this subject a few remarks as regards men wearing shorts may not be out of place—there are occasions when these are suitable and also when they are not so, and in the writer’s humble opinion one of the latter is in the Cinema. One has only to look down from the gallery on the audience seated below consisting of Eurasions, Malays, Chinese and others and without exception, almost, they are dressed in clean white or some suit with collar and tie, whilst some in the gallery (Europeans, who, by the way, should set the example) are dressed in a slovenly shirt and shorts as if they had (and probably have) just come from football or golf and had not changed; they appear in them also nt the late performance, leading to the inference that they have not even changed for dinner; do they sleep in them too? And would these individuals appear in such a dress in the better seats of a cinema or theatre in London, and if not, why do so here? And anyway, what is the matter with a clean white 5-button suit? In the last few years the tendency to become slovenly in our dress seems to increase and it is a curious fact that the more careless we get, the more Malays and Chinese turn out better dressed (not that the writer at all approves of European dress for most of them, and it is a pity they will not realize how much nicer they look in their own), but the fact remains that it is so, and the example is being set us instead of the reverse being the case; in days gone by people overdressed; nowadays they are underdressed: is there no happy medium ? Doubtless I shall have the whole of the “Shorts Brigade” against me, asking whether all this matters, and for certain I shall have the old adage “other times other manners” thrown at me, but I happen to have been out here long enough to know what does matter and what does not. and therefore am opposed to anything that is likely to cause adverse criticism. It is incumbent on us to keep our end up, a process which is not by any means so generally understood as it ought to be. Trusting that no one will take the above remarks in bad part, and thanking you, Sir, for allowing me so much space. I am, Yours faithfully, “OBSERVER.” The MONDAY NOVEMBER 2nd. 1936. Death. ARJAN J. LALCHAND.—On 16th October, 1936, at 1.55 a.m„ at the General Hospital, Kuching, son of Mr. & Mrs. J. Lalchand of the Luxini Store. Kuching. Aged 8 years. Had attended St. Mary's School for 3 years. Acknowledgment ----------- ------------ Mr. & Mrs. J. Lalchand of the Luxmi Store. Kuching, tender their heartfelt thanks to their many friends who so kindly sent wreaths, scrolls and letters of condolence upon the death of their son Arjan J. Lalchand and also to those who attended the funeral on 10th October, 1936. Mr. Chin Shin Sen begs to lender his thanks to all friends and relatives who sent wreaths and letters of condolence during his recent bereavement and also those who attended his beloved and loving wife's funeral on 11th October, 1936, Local and Personal. OCTOBER. His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie sailed from Marseilles by P.&O. s.s. Comorin on October 30th, and are due to reach Singapore on November 20th. Their Highnesses are expected to arrive in Kuching by the Vyner Brooke on November 23rd. Her Highness the Ranee is due to arrive about a fortnight later. Mr. A. W. D. Brooke left Kuching for the Third Division in H.H.M.Y. Maimuna on October 8th. and took over his new duties at Nanga Meluan on the 12th. Other passengers by the Maimuna were Dayang Anne, Mr. C. D. Adams, Resident, Third Division, and Mrs. Adams, Miss F. A. Putnam, and the Rev. Father C. Epping, who was returning to Dalat after a visit to Kuching.—his first for five years. Miss Putnam is staying at. Sibu for a week or two as the guest of Mr. and Mrs. C. D. Adams. Dayang Anne returned to Kuching on October 17th. Major W. F. N. Bridges. Deputy Surveyor General. S.S. & F.M.S.. arrived in Kuching by the Vyner Brooke on October 23rd. We understand that Major Bridges is to spend six months in Sarawak in order to survey the rubber restriction position. Shortly after the Bau gold hold-up, an account of which will be found elsewhere in this issue, the District Officer, Bau. was stopped on his way to Kuching by a Sikh policeman, who informed him politely and in very good English that he had orders to search all cars coming from Bau. On being informed that the occupant of the car was none other than the District Officer, he saluted and said—“Oh. I beg your pardon, Sir. I thought you were a Christian The District Officer proceeded on his way to Kuching, rather puzzled as to the connection between his religious beliefs and a highway robbery. H.M.S. Herald paid two visits to Kuching during the month, namely from October 23rd to 26th. and from October 30th to November 2nd. A welcome visitor was Mrs. Hardy, the wife of Commander N. A. C. Hardy, R.N.. who arrived by the Vyner Brooke on October 23rd. Mrs. Hardy, who leaves for Singapore early in November, is staving at the Residency as the guest of Mr. and Mrs. W. F. Dick. At 8.0 p.m. on the night of Sunday, November 1st, the Captain and Officers of H.M.S. Herald were ‘at home’ to about fifty guests, having very kindly issued an open invitation to the European residents of Kuching. Fortunately the weather, which had been threatening, remained fine, and nothing occurred to mar a most delightful evening, and one which afforded those of the guests who were new to Naval hospitality an excellent opportunity of finding out just what this means, and just how good it can be. Receptions of this nature on board warships are always a success, but to us in Sarawak ‘the packetvaart’ is more than just a passing man-of-war; during the past nine or ten years she has maintained such a close association with Sarawak that we have almost ceased to regard her as one of H.M. ships, and have come to think of her as a floating piece of Sarawak territory, so to speak. It is there¬ fore only natural that an atmosphere of more than ordinary cordiality should prevail between the ship and the shore, and that the Herald’s personnel should be regarded not merely as so many Naval Officers and ratings, but as close personal friends. This feeling was very evident on board the Herald on Sunday night, and helped to make the recap tion a truly memorable occasion. The success of the party was assured from the start, however, by the excellent organization on the part of the hosts, to whom our heartiest thanks are due for a most enjoyable evening, —which somehow extended well into the morning! It is good to know that we shall have a chance of repaying the Herald's hospitality next year. H.M.S. Herald sailed for Singapore and Hong Kong on November 2nd. Mr. R. B. Summers, of the Land and Survey Department, who has resigned his appoint¬ ment in the Government Service, left for Europe from Sibu on October 24th. His many friends in Sarawak will join with us in wishing him all success in his new career. Mr. Summers paid a short farewell visit to Kuching before leaving, returning to Sibu by m.v. Rejang on October 20th. We must congratulate (rather belatedly !) Mr. and Mrs. W. Philp on the birth of a daughter, which arrived on October 1st. Mr. and Mrs. Philp and their daughter returned to Kuching from Singapore on October 12th. We also welcome back Mrs. Hutchison, who arrived from Europe on the same day. Mr. C. W. S. Gardner, Visiting Agent, and Mr. R. F. Burt, a Director of Tanah Estates, Ltd., Kanowit, paid a visit to the estate during the month and returned to Singapore via Kuching. Octoter was a notable month for athletics in Kuching, no less than three large meetings being held, the occasions being China’s National Day. the St. Thomas’ School Jubilee Celebrations, and the annual meeting of St. Joseph's School. Full accounts of each meeting will be found under “First Division News. We have received from the Rev. Father A. Klerk. Rector of the Roman Catholic Mission, Kanowit, a volume of Bible History (Old and New Testaments) prepared by Father Klerk and translated by him into the Sea Dayak language. Father Klerk is well known as an authority on Sea Dayak language and customs, having spent some 40 years in the Kanowit district, and this book is a striking tribute both to his industry and scholarship. Apart from its importance to Mission workers in Dayak areas, this Bible History will prove of great interest and value to all students of the Sea Dayak language, to whom it can be heartily recommended. The book is excellently hound and printed, and copies can be obtained from the Rev. Father Klerk at the very moderate prices of $1 and 75 cents for linen and board bindings res¬ pectively. Father Klerk is to be congra¬ tulated on a remarkable achievement. Highway Robbery in First Division. CAR HELD UP ON BAU —KUCHING ROAD. A bad case of gang robbery, a crime from which Sarawak has until now been comparatively free, occurred just, after 1.0 p.m. on October 23rd at the 9th Mile, Bau Road. The victim was Mr. Ong Eng Hin, the Manager of Bukit Young Gold Mine, who was taking a bar of gold worth $3,000 and $800 in cash from the mine to Kuching. The taxi in which Mr. Ong and two other Chinese were travelling was held up by a rubber tree that had been felled across the road; as soon as the car stopped, it was surrounded by seven masked Chinese armed with sticks, knives, a revol¬ ver and a home-made bomb, the latter being placed in front of the car, where it exploded without doing any damage. The robbers forced Mr. Ong to sur¬ render the gold bar and the cash and then seized everything that was of the slightest value, including some clothing, and made off. The news of the crime was telephoned to Kuching from the Police station at the 7th Mile, and detach¬ ments of Constabulary were at once dent to the scene of the robbery and also to Batu Kawa, with orders to patrol all roads and paths leading towards Sinia- wan. A clue was obtained on the river bank about 200 yards from the scene of the hold-up. several Government bills and receipts bearing Mr. Ong Eng Hin's name being found here; it was known that these bills had been in Mr. Ong's pocket book, which the robbers had taken. Moreover, footprints and the mark of the bow of a boat were seen in the mud of the river bank, and police were sent across river to patrol all paths and make a general search of the neighbourhood. About 5.0 p.m. one of the patrols saw two men about 150 yards away walking in the direction of Batu Kawa. The men at once bolted into the undergrowth on catching sight of the police, who gave chase and succeeded in arresting them both, although it was raining heavily at the time and visibility was very poor amongst the trees. The two men turned out to be Khehs, and one of them was seen to throw away a bundle of clothes and a towel when pursued. These were retrieved, and the bun¬ dle was found to contain a revolver loaded in three chambers; among the clothes were some that were later identified by Mr. Ong Eng Hin as those which had been stolen from the car. The other man tried to dispose of a parany, which, when examined was seen to be still wet and sticky as though it had lately been used for cutting a rubber tree. A thorough search in the undergrowth revealed nothing further, and both prisoners, who were local men, denied all knowledge of the robbery. As a result of information received a further search was made some days later in the babas near the place where this arrest took place, (about three miles from Batu Kawa,) and eventually the gold bar was found, together with some other clothes that had been taken from the car at the same time as the gold. The police have the names of other persons suspected of having been concerned in the robbery, and one further arrest has been made, details of which are not yet to band. This hold-up, the first of its kind in Sarawak, was carried out in a style worthy of the best tradition of Hollywood's gangsters. Indeed, the masks, bomb and pistol were rather overdoing things since as a rule the producer of even the most lurid film knows better nowadays than to impose on the credulity of the public with such an overwhelming display of crook's paraphernalia. All of which goes to show that truth really is stranger than fiction, and that Chinese criminals must lie peculiarly susceptible to the influence of the kind of detective story that one now finds only in boys' papers. This time, however, their efforts to make the flesh of law-abiding citizens creep were spoilt by the excellent work of the Constabulary, whose recovery of the stolen gold must rank as one of the best pieces of police work carried out in Sarawak for a long time. The Constabulary Officers and other ranks concerned are to be congratulated on the success of their efforts and on the initiative and acumen displayed, which must have proved highly discouraging to other intending Dick Turpins. A Note On Food. IV. The old outstation 'dead hen’ legend dies hard. When one has had to face a Hylam cook's idea of chicken for luncheon and dinner most days of the week for two or three years, one is apt to grow a trifle embittered, and to view the humble but necessary fowl with jaundiced eyes. Indeed, the time comes when the mere sight of one of the creatures scratching about in the garden fills one with a feeling of angry resentment, and when the prospect of the skinny drumsticks that one will have to face in a few hours' time evokes a truly Chekhovian mood of frustration and despair. This is understandable, but not unavoidable, for there are two solutions to the 'dead hen' problem. The first is to make an intelligent use of fish, eggs and vegetables in order not to have to rely on chicken as the daily staple dish even in places where fresh meat is unobtainable; the second is to ensure, by the exercise of a little care, that when one does have to eat chicken it shall be neither tough nor unpalatable. Chicken has acquired a bad name in Sarawak because it is almost always spoiled before it ever reaches the table. There are three essential rules to be observed when preparing fowls for eating the birds should be young, if possible, they should be hung for at least eighteen hours before cooking, and they should always be plucked by hand. The average cook, like Gallio, cares for none of these things. He buys the cheapest fowl he can find irrespective of it’s age; he kills it a couple of hours before it is due to appear on the table, thereby ensuring that its flesh shall have the consistency of rubber; and he facilitates the removal of its feathers by plunging it into boiling water, thus removing at the same time the greater part of its flavour. The observance of the three rules I have mentioned turns 'dead hen’ into chicken. The bird that is to be eaten for luncheon should be killed not later than the previous evening; eighteen hours is never too long to hang a fowl in Sarawak, even in the hottest weather, and one can often go up to thirty hours with safety. Twenty- four hours can be taken as the golden mean, given normal conditions. It is this, combined with hand-plucking, that makes all the difference. Those who are accus¬ tomed to hear the dying screams of the luncheon chicken an hour or so before the meal is served (a common enough outstation experience!) simply will not recognize a bird that has been adequately hung and properly prepared. In the one case, the flesh is appallingly tough and quite tasteless; in the other, the texture and flavour approximate fairly closely to the real thing. Outstation chicken can be very nearly as good as its English counter¬ part, which is saying something. Chicken in Sarawak is usually cooked by being quartered and thrown into a frying pan with some dripping or (more often) kachang oil. or even minyak babi. As an alternative it appears roast, boiled, or in the form of a greasy stew. And then there is, of course, that sinister compound known as 'chicken cutlet,'—this is a conglomeration of those portions of the fowl’s anatomy of which the bird, when alive, had least reason to be proud, welded together by some mysterious alchemy and drenched in a sauce composed of grease thickened with flour and insufficiently fried onions. Yet there are other and better ways of cooking fowls. They are very good, for instance, cut up and grilled with bacon ever a hot charcoal fire, then served with mushrooms, peas and mushed potatoes, and garnished with their own livers, also grilled. Fried chicken a la Maryland is so well known that it needs no description, but how often do we see it in Sarawak? Why. in the name of common sense, should restaurants have the mono¬ poly of this excellent and comparatively simple dish? Again, chicken can be braised in a number of ways and served 'en casserole’ with all kinds of different accompaniments; any cookery book will furnish half a dozen recipes, and these can be added to by invention. Why not try them? What about chicken stewed with whole ears of sweet corn, for instance? Or chicken braised with bacon, pimentos, spices, and a generous quantity of chopped onions? Done in this way no liquid is required,—that is provided by the onions. After simmering for four hours in a closed earthenware dish the onions will be found to have disappeared entirely, leaving only a sauce the mere smell of which will make your mouth water. Surprisingly enough, the flavour of onions by no means predomi¬ nates : the dish is enormously improved by the addition of a dash of brown sherry shortly before serving. If you are using a large number of fowls, a good idea is to save the livers and use them for risotto, a simple but delightful Italian dish which makes a very pleasant change. They can also be served CH brochette, namely grilled on a skewer, the livers being interspersed with mushrooms and pieces of bacon; and of course angels on horse¬ back -chicken livers rolled in a rasher of bacon, fried and served on pieces of crisp fried bread— make a first rate savoury. Arroz à la Valenciana, a Spanish dish consisting of rice fried with saffron, chicken, pimento, fish, crayfish and mussels is so good that I shall describe it in detail. Cook some krang*, open them, and set them aside. Boil about a [pound of tenggiri or other firm sea fish (eels are frequently used in Spain) and one crayfish in some salted water, set aside when cooked, but leave the head of the cray¬ fish in the stock. Add to this the liquor from the krang. Quarter a chicken, fry it in butter with some sliced onions, cover with water to which has been added a little meat stock or a couple of bouillon cubes, and cook for one hour. Set aside separately the chicken and the stock. * The local cockle.—to take the place of mussels. Strain the fish and chicken stocks and put them into a pan. Fry the requisite quantity of rice in oil, moisten with the boiling stock and add some pimentos. Season with care, and add saffron. Cover the pan and cook over a moderate heat for twenty minutes; by that time the rice is cooked but not quite dry. Take the lid off and leave the pan over a very low heat for at least half an hour, from time to time stirring the rice at the bottom of the pan up to the surface with a wooden spoon. Before serving (in a casserole) add the chicken, the krang the fish cut in chunks, also the crayfish, which should be split in half and left in its shell. This dish makes an admirable substitute for the Sunday curry. Before leaving the subject of chicken—having. I hope, done something to dissipate the aura of fear and distaste which hangs over that bird—let me mention poulet. Demidoff, a delicious dish all the ingredients of which can be obtained in any Sarawak outstation. The recipe, too, can be found in any good cookery book. One day I shall go to a dinner-party expecting to eat the usual roast chicken with bread sauce, greasy roast potatoes and string beans, and to my delight I shall be given instead poulet Demidoff. One day.—yes, perhaps. But not, I fear, in Sarawak. Few people realise how good the local duck can he if properly prepared and rooked. The rules laid down for fowls apply equally to ducks except that since they are usually rather dirty feeders and hence liable to deteriorate more rapidly than chickens, the period of hanging should be slightly reduced. A duck that has been adequately hung and well roasted is a splendid dish; it should be served with souffle or fried potatoes, peas, and an orange salad. Duck is very good braised with bacon and green peas, but when doing the preliminary frying remember that ducks usually have a good layer of fat which enables one to dispense to a great extent with butter or any other oil. Remember, too. that since tinned cooked peas will have to take the place of fresh peas, these should not be added until the duck is nearly done, though the liquor from the tin should be used, with the addition of stock, as the braising medium. Boast duck can he excellent cold, provided it is kept on the ice before serving and is accompanied by a salad with a rather tort dressing. Cold lean bacon is another good accessory,—provided, again, that it is really cold. No mention of duck would he complete without some reference to Chinese methods of preparing it. The Chinese are supposed to be able to cook a duck in eighty different ways, and seeing that they can make a most appetising dish out. of only the skin, this is not hand to believe. If you are lucky enough to employ a good Chinese cook, you can give him a free hand when it conies to duck ; honed and stuffed in the Chinese fashion, it is a dish to remember. Pigeons, which can be bred with comparatively little trouble, figure all too seldom in Sarawak menus. They arc a welcome change from chicken and duck, and can be cooked in a number of intri¬ guing ways. They are very good, for instance, wrapped in a rasher of fat, bacon and roasted on a spit in front of a charcoal fire, the bacon dripping being used for basting purposes; they are also delicious stuffed with lotus seeds and slewed in the Chinese fashion, and if they are combined with ham. hard boiled egg. beef steak (if obtainable) kidneys, and krang, they make the sort of pie you dream about. Indeed, pigeons have such possibi¬ lities that I shall break my rule and quote the following recipe from a French cookery book :— “Cover the birds with fat bacon rashers and fry in a braising pan. Add a little water and some salt, cover and braise carefully. When cooked, dish up on a bed of potato purée; add a glass of port to the contents of the pan, boil up (or five minutes and pour over the dish." And here is a recipe of my own which is extravagant hut. delicious : — Wrap each bird in a rasher of fat bacon and secure with a few turns of coarse thread. Stuff with a mixture composed of the liver, breadcrumbs, minced ham and about six skinned and seeded grapes: if these are slightly unripe, so much the better. (Grapes can be obtained quite cheaply in the bazaar. Place the birds in a stew-pan and fry in the dripping from the bacon with a little sliced onion : moisten with some strong stock and a generous allowance of dry white wine, add some rice, and cook over a low heat until the birds are lender. Remove the thread from the pigeons, transfer to an earthenware casserole, add some grapes (but leave the skins on, this time), and. plenty of tinned button mushrooms. Moisten again, if necessary, with the mushroom liquor and more wine, and simmer until the rice is thoroughly cooked. Serve in a casserole with a few croutons of crisp fried bread. Well, that finishes the poultry. leathered game is not plentiful in Sarawak, and in most outstations is confined to snipe (in season) and curtain kinds of wild pigeon. The only varieties of the latter with which we are concerned are, in descending order of size, pergam, perdidi and punai. Pergam are large birds with plenty of meat on them; the only trouble is that it is so tough that it is not worth eating. There is only one real way to cook a pergam, and that is to Lang it for a full 21 hours, then skin it (most important) and stew it with some fat bacon, a clove or two, a good deal of salt and pepper, and plenty of onions. Simmer for six hours at least in a closed pan, then take out the pergam and give it to the dog. Strain the liquor that remains in the pan. add a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and you have a passable soup. Perdidi are fairly good eating, since although they are apt to he a trifle stringy, they are not nearly so tough as pergam, and so can be treated in the same way as domestic pigeons, -always assuming that they have been properly hung. Punai are excellent, having a delicate garney flavour all their own; they should be wrapped in a rasher of bacon, fried and served on a piece of fried bread, or else made into a pie: they are also good served ‘en casserole’ with mushrooms and green peas. The snip’ is the king of all game birds in Sarawak. Tie can be fried in the same way as a punai. but he is at his best roasted in front of a charcoal fire, with or without bacon,—in either case he should be well basted, or else he is apt to bo rather dry. A snipe, of course, should always be served complete with head, which is a great tit-bit ; for those who eat breakfast there is no better meal than a couple of snipe properly cooked and served, and the smell of them cooking has been known to make even habitual non-breakfasters put down their glass and reach with trembling hands for a knife and fork. Rusa and kijang. the two species of deer most frequently encountered in Sarawak, furnish excellent venison, again always assuming that they are hung for a reasonable time. They should be 'gralloched and skinned as soon after killing as possible, and then hung in a cool place for at least 18 hours. In the meantime, you can make a meal off the liver, which is quite excellent by itself, or fried with bacon and onions.—it has a rather strong flavour which is most intriguing. It is also delicious cut in thin slices and eaten cold with a vinaigrette sauce. Venison (for let us call it that) can be cooked in almost as many different ways as any other kind of meat. A roast haunch of rusa is a noble dish either hot or cold: if the latter, serve with chutney, you will be surprised how it brings out the flavour. The bones and 'trimmings’, too, can he made into a very good soup, with or without vegetables; indeed, venison is one of the most welcome additions to the outstation menu. If you want a really unforgettable dish, line a casserole with cubes of fat bacon then add alternate layers of venison cut in chunks, pimento, and chopped onions, using plenty of the latter. Each layer should be seasoned with salt, a very little chili and a liberal sprinkling of paprika, which you can buy locally in bottles. Simmer for four hours and you will find that the onions have again done the vanishing trick: the result is an especially tasty version of ‘goulash’, a dish of national importance in Hungary and one which gives downtrodden plants in the Carpathians fresh hope, and a new faith in life. It should be served with macaroni ent into strips about four inches long and sprinkled with grated cheese. If half a glass of brown sherry is added just before serving, this glorious dish will be still further improved. V. And now we come to vegetables, which perhaps suffer more injustice and indignity in Sarawak kitchens than anything else. To start with, a number of local vegetables ought never to come within shouting-distance of the kitchen at all; there is. tor instance, a greyish, semi-transparent sub¬ stance that is usually served cut in unappetising looking chunks. What this substance is. I have never discovered ; it is alleged to be a vegetable and is apparently edible, since I have seen people eat it often enough, and have even tried it myself on occasion without ill effects. The taste is not unpleasant for the simple reason that it has no taste at all. It is utterly negative, like eating a lump of solidified fog. Yet in Sarawak people swallow this stuff regularly, not because they like it, but because their cook gives it them. Among other vegetables that should be black¬ listed by anyone with any respect for his palate are boiled cucumber, string beans, carrots, anti those slimy abominations known as ladies’ fingers’. This is a grisly enough list, certainly, but it is not so discouraging as it sounds since there are plenty of good local vegetables if one takes the trouble to look around for them. One of the best of these is rebong (bamboo-shoots) which is very good hot. with a little butter and salt, and which, when cold, makes a first-class salad. Mention of butter, incidentally, reminds me that the English use it all too seldom in vegetable cookery, preferring to boil vegetables until all their flavour and nourishment have been transferred to the surrounding water, which is then thrown down the sink. No Frenchwoman would dream of boiling vegetables unless she intends to make soup out of The Rat Menace in Padi Fields. The following extract from ‘Anak Singa- pura’s’ column in the Straits Times throws an interesting light on some aspects of a problem which, in Sarawak, is always with us, and for which no effective solution appears to be in sight. The havoc wrought by rats in the Baram padi fields this year has been so serious that Mr. E. Banks, the Curator, Sarawak Museum, is at present on a visit to that district in order to make investigations, and. if possible, to devise some means of checking their depredations—ED. RATTUS RATTUS The other day we discoursed on Malayan locusts. To-day our subject shall be the rice-field rat. Most people do not know that there is a distinct rat of the rice-fields, but there is. and in some ways he is a much more prepossessing animal than the other three Malayan species, the jungle rat, the house rat and the English wharf rat (an alien who has established himself in coastal towns m this country). Your rice-field rat. who rejoices in the name of Rattus Rattus Argentiventer, is one of the cleanest- feeding animals in existence, for its diet is mainly vegetarian, and the main item in that diet i- succulent unripe padi, although it is not averse to an occasion grasshopper as well. The motorist, when driving through padi districts, often sees places in the middle of the fields which look as though a runaway buffalo has trampled down the growing crop. But in nine times out of ten that is not the correct explanation; Rattus Rattus Argentiventcr has been at work, gnawing through the stalks of the padi near their base. Here we see the intelligence of the rat demon¬ strated. for he damages only the centre of the field, invariably leaving a thick fringe of standing padi to provide cover and screen his borrows around the edges of the field. NINETY BABIES. People who like permutations and combinations should try them on the rut : they will be amazed at the result. No less than five and a half million rats were destroyed in six years in Krian, in an area of 80,000 acres during the 1925-30 campaign of the Agricultural Department. As every one of those dead rats earned a bounty of a Cent a tail, there must have been abounding cheerfulness in Krian at that time, especially among the Tamils, who. in addition to selling the tail, did not disdain to pop the rat into their curry. And what's more, they ranged far and wide in their rat¬ hunting, so that although Government's purpose was to kill off the rats in the rice-fields alone, it was in fact paying out money for a large proportion of rats which were living blameless lives elsewhere. But to return to the question of how it was possible to catch such a stupendous number of rats : this is not so surprising when we learn that a single female can produce from 60 to 90 young ones in a single breeding season, which lasts from February to July. Two litters have been found in one nest at the same time, one just able to walk and the other being suckled by the indefatigable mother. If unchecked, the rice-field rat would be a real menace to Malaya's food supply, for it has been known to destroy one-sixth of the total crop in Krian. In that particular year. no less than a million gantangs of padi went to feed rats instead of human beings. COBRA HORROR. The (error of the rat world is the black cobra. which swarms in the padi fields during the breeding season, and those beautiful emerald-green fields that we see from the high-road conceal many a ghastly tragedy. Take for example the scene that met the eyes of a European officer who was making a special study of the rice-field rat when his coolies suddenly cut off the end of a bund, exposing a mother rat bravely standng over a nest containing 18 babies, with a large cobra on the edge of the nest ready to strike. Nature red in tooth and claw. . . . The rat makes complicated burrows, sometimes 60 feet long, in the earth bunds dividing the fields, and in order to escape from snakes he almost always constructs an exit below water level, so that he can swim to safety when hard-pressed. Some of the burrows will he carried as far as three or four yards horizontally below wat er level. When the padi fields are dry, however, the majority of the rats leave the earth bunds and make long, shallow burrows outside. Tins makes possible the use of a very simple type of trip. It consists merely of a short length of bamboo placed in a runway. The rat regards it as part of the runway and spends the night in it. The next morning the trapper approaches quietly, plugs both ends of the bamboo with a handful of grass, and the rat is caught. But it is advisable to use a good thick handful of grass, leaf the tenant of the trap should happen to be a cobra ! Who Was It?

The following are extracts from the report of the Resident, First Division : — ' I visited the 7th mile bazaar on September 1st, together with the Assistant Superintendent of Lands and Surveys, to discuss the proposed bazaar scheme with Mr. William Tan, who owns much of the property affected. Mr. Tan agreed to co-operate. "On the 4th I visited Sedan with Mr. T. A. Reid of the Public Works Department; the contractor for the new police barracks appears to be getting on well with the preliminary work, and the frame¬ work should be up before the end of the month. ‘ On 14th I left at 6 a.m. to proceed to Nanga Tuang, Samarahan, via the 27th mile, Simang- gang Road, where 1 met the District Officer, Serian; from there we proceeded down river in the m.l. Vava, arriving at Nanga Tuang at 11 p.m. I discussed the proposed bazaar with the local traders, who agreed to build provided some restriction could be placed on boat-hawkers, of whom there are a great number in the district. I left at 2 p.m. by m.l. Vava, and using Loba Gong arrived at Pending at 4 p.m. "The Lands and Surveys Department com¬ pleted a plan of the 10th mile bazaar which I had asked for. and the state of affairs there turned out to be worse than anticipated; grants issued in 1917 conditional on shophouses being built within eighteen months had not been complied with, sheds had been erected on a road reserve, pig-ponds had been dug close up to the backs of the houses, and even on the road reserve. Notices of re-entry on some of the grants have been issued, but it will take a long time to clean up the bazaar as a whole." Thirty-four civil and sixty-five criminal cases came before the Kuching courts during September. The sentence of death passed upon Jeti alias Liang alias Linggi (Dayak) for the murder of Ah Seng (Hylam) and his wife Tek (Dayak), was carried out-on September 12th, 1936. On September 7th a verdict of suicide during temporary insanity was recorded at an inquiry into the death of Kung Ah Kim, a prisoner, who hanged himself in the General Hospital. The District Officer, Kuching, records with regret the deaths of Haji Mohamad Rais, Datu Imam Tua. and Mohamad Atay bin Wahap, Tua Kampong of of No. 2 Kampong, Kuching. Haji Mohamad Rais was appointed Datu Imam on June 24th. 1907, after serving some fifteen years as Tua Kampong in Sibu. On February 7th, 1925. he retired from active participation in the Govern¬ ment but continued to draw his salary and allowance as a member of the Supreme Council until his death on September 24th. Mohamad Atay, who died on September 20th, was appointed Tua Kampong in 1924. A scheme for the future development of the villages at Bako. Goebilt, Muara Tetas and Sautu- bong was submitted to the Lands and Surveys Department, and the areas are now being surveyed. During the month a report was received that thousands of caterpillars were destroying the young padi in the vicinity of the 21st mile, Penrissen Road. Steps were taken immediately to exterminate these pests, whose depredations extended over an area of about fifty acres. Unfortunately the Dayaks set up their pantang signs before the whole, area had been sprayed, and the Agricultural Department had to discontinue operations. It has since been decided, however, to disregard all such pantang in order that measures may be taken to prevent these pests spreading into other padi farms. The District Officer. Kuching, paid a routine visit to Lundu during the month. A very enjoyable regatta was held at this station on the morning of September 19th. There was no lack of entries and all the races were well contested. A sports, meeting had been arranged for the after¬ noon, but owing to heavy rain, it was feared that the meeting would have been to be postponed. Early in the afternoon, however, large crowds. undeterred by the • downpour, assembled, and all the events were Carried out. Every village from Telok Serabang to Bako and Stungkor was well represented, and the proceedings were heartily enjoyed by all communities, though one or two muttered protests were heard when almost every race was won by boats and crews of Kampong Salak. H.M.S. Herald arrived at Pending on. September 25th and left on the 29th. Entertainments arranged for the ship's company included hockey. football and cricket matches against Kuching teams. One flying-boat of N.o. 205 Squadron. Royal Air Force, conveying Air Commodore S. W. Smith, O.B.E., R.A.F., alighted at Pending on September 30th. This being Air Commodore Smith’s last visit to Sarawak, an official reception was arranged. Visitors to Kuching during the month included Dr. A. D. Hutchison, Mr. and Mrs. I. S. Ham¬ mond. Miss F. A. Putnam and Mr. Jan Jacob de Boer. The District Officer, Bau, states that there was no serious crime in his district during the month. 442 persons were treated and 18 N.A.B injections were given during September at the Bau Govern¬ ment dispensary. Four persons were treated by the Dresser for poisoning,—the after-effects of a heavy meal of mushrooms; after some six hours of unconsciousness, they recovered. Dahan Rubber Estates, Ltd., harvested 17.500 lbs. of dry rubber. Rainfall at Bau was 6.18 inches, and at Dahan 8.81 inches. The following table gives the individual output of gold from the various mines for August, 1936 :— The Native Officer, Lundu, records with deep regret the death of Orang Kaya Lehan of Pueh, which took place on September 27th after a long illness. This Orang Kaya served Government for. twenty-five years with loyalty, and was entitled to receive his long service decoration on the 26th; unfortunately the decoration did not arrive in time for delivery. On the morning of September 19th a regatta was held al Lundu, while land sports and football took place in the afternoon. Entries for most of the events exceeded expectations, and a very large crowd witnessed the proceedings. The District Officer, Mr. G. F. J. Pegler, very kindly presented the regatta and spurts prizes. At night a dinner was held in the Kubu to which about forty persons sat down. It was also decided to hold a bangsawan after the dinner, but unfortunately heavy rain came down and the performance had to be postponed until the following night. All natives in the Sadong district have been busy planting out. A very severe storm struck the coast at the beginning of the month and at Sebandi over thirty fruit trees in the kampong were blown down, and three Malay houses were completely destroyed, Fortunately there were no serious accidents. The District Officer, Serian and Samarahan, states that more applications for coconut planting at Kuala Sadong and along the coast were received during September. The applications by Sampun Dayaks needed further investigation, so the Native Officer visited that kampong during the month and had not returned by the end of the. month. A number of judgment summons were issued against quit rent defaulters and a threat to auction their gardens made nearly all pay up. ST. THOMAS’ SCHOOL JUBILEE CELEBRATIONS. SATURDAY. OCTOBER 3RD. SPORTS. Saturday, October 3rd, was a day memorable not only to those who are under the roof of the school, but also because it was a day full of lively amuse¬ ment and excitement for those who wore there to witness, or to participate in, the proceedings of the day on which the school, with the support of the old hoys, observed its Golden Jubilee celebrations. Since the early morning the school playing field was seen to be beautifully bedecked with flags and brightly coloured streamers that fluttered in the morning breeze, and to have running tracks and hurdles well arranged, all of which bespoke the holding of a sports meeting and other forms of entertaining displays. An artistic and charac¬ teristic porch was erected at the entrance to the field ; the grandstand, too, which was built by the side of the play-ground, was fittingly decorated with palms and greenery of all descriptions, suggesting obviously the perpetual freshness and increasing progress of the old school After noon spectators began to pour from all directions into that section of the town where the playing field is situated and to gather themselves in crowds by the hundreds on the surrounding hill¬ slopes and on the roadside in eager expectation to view the sports. Likewise, the stand for the guests was soon filled to overflowing. At a little past one in the afternoon the events as set forth in the programme were kept going in an orderly manner under a brilliant sky. The spoils included the ordinary track and field events with a number of amusing races besides, such as two-in-a-sack race and bun-and-lemonade. also a few daylight fire-works. The invitation girls’ events added much “spice” to the programme. All the events were very keenly contested, and many good athletic attempts were accomplished which are a great credit to the young amateur competitors. The spectators were kept amused and interested from beginning to end, and everything was so well arranged that there was no undue delay or dull moments. Unfortunately a downpour of rain fell half-way through the programme, hut this unpleasant natural phenomenon was seemingly unobserved and tanfelt by the performers and spectators alike. The officials stood in the rain like stone pillars, or otherwise stalked about the place like ducks, apparently enjoying it all the more. Among the distinguished guests were His High¬ ness the Tuan Muda and Dayang Anne, who arrived at the scene before the rain had quite stopped. After alighting at the porch they were welcomed and afterwards conducted to the pavilion by Archdeacon Hollis, the Principal of the school. Upon their arrival at the stand the Sarawak Anthem was played and the royal ensign was unfurled. After a thrilling and hard fight in a tug-of-war between the present and old boys of the school, which was enthusiastically backed by supporters of the rival teams, the Dayang. at the request of Mr. Tan Sum Quart, very graciously gave away the prizes to the victors of the day Before the crowd dispersed three hearty cheers rang out from the youthful throats of the boys for His Highness the Rajah, followed by three others for His Highness the Tuan Muda and the Dayang Anne. At HOME. At the conclusion of the sports the guests proceeded to an “At Home” given by the Principal and Staff of the school in the boarding houses. Owing to the wet weather the tea and other refreshments were served indoors contrary to what was originally planned, and due to the same reason the number of guests present was much smaller than what was anticipated. All those who took courage to he there, however, were justly rewarded by the kind reception which they received from their hosts and the timely refreshment of which they partook on the lavishly laid tables. During the reception the Constabulary Band played lively airs which were appreciated by all. DINNER. On the same night at 8 o'clock, the old boys of the school gave a Chinese Dinner in honour of the school Jubilee in the school Assembly Hall where 280 persons were present. Besides His Lordship the Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak, the Arch¬ deacon of Sarawak, Members of the Community of the Resurrection. European and Asiatic Missionaries and members of the staffs of St. Thomas' and St. Mary's Schools, the following distinguished guests were present :—His Highness the Tuan Muda, the Dayang Anne, Mr. Anthony Brooke, the Resident and Mrs. Dick, the Secretary for Internal Affairs and the Chief Justice. One interesting thing worthy of comment is that the Malay old boys and their friends also joined in this unique function, being served separately with Malay food. The Constabulary Band and the string band rendered by the Quop old boys played selections during the dinner. Tn spite of the huge number of diners, the servers and cooks managed to cope with their work in applepie order without any impediment. Soon after the dinner was over, Mr. Tan Sum Guan, who presided at the meeting, proposed the toast of His Highness the Rajah, which was drunk in a loyal and fitting manner. He next gave a speech, as follows "Your Highness, Mr. Brooke, Dayang, Your Lordship. Ladies and Gentlemen. “On behalf of the old boys of St. Thomas’ School I have to thank you one and all most sincerely for your kind response to their invitation on the occasion of the celebration of the Golden Jubliee of their school. We are especially glad and honoured to have with us to-night His Highness the Tuan Muda and his family. “Actually the school has been established for more than 80 years, for Bishop MacDougall, the first missionary to come to this country. arrived here in the year 1848, and it was probably a few years thereafter that the school started its life in small way. The celebration that is taking place to-day really refers to the age of the present main building of the school. "From a mere handful of boys at the commence¬ ment it has grown to be the largest school in this country with about 480 boys on the roll. In addition to this number, there are at present, I understand. 165 little boys, who are under the charge of Miss Andrews in St. Mary’s School. In order to make the old boys realise what the S .P. G. Mission has contributed to their education, I think it is not out of place to make the following references. "Perhaps most of you are not aware of what the Mission has expended on its work in Borneo. I cannot go into figures now, but it is safe to say that in the last 80 years a sum of more than four million dollars must have been sent from England to support the work of the Diocese of Labuan and Sarawak. Even with all this monetary assistance from England. the school would not have been able to stand on its feet, had it not been for the valuable support from His Highness the Rajah and his Government. who arc always liberal in helping the school with their grants-in-aid. “All the boys of St. Thomas’ School, past and present, therefore owe a deep debt of gratitude to both the Mission and to His Highness the Rajah, and it is my earnest hope that they will ever be mindful of the benefits derived by them and their children for their education. "Ladies and Gentlemen. I would now ask you all to join me in drinking to the health of His Highness the Tuan Muda.” Haji Bol Hassan on behalf of Datu Shah-Bandar, Data Amar and other old Malay boys of the school, then stood up to express their gratitude for what the school had done for them, speaking both in English and Malay. In reply to the above His Highness the Tuan Muda stated that he was very pleased to find such a large cosmopolitan gathering at the dinner, which went to show how friendly the old boys of the school were keeping with everybody in the country He said that the school had certainly done good work and is still continuing to make further progress He wished it every success in the future. The Resident, Mr. W. F. Dick, next proposed the toast of the school. This was drunk with great enthusiasm. He particularly mentioned the name of Archdeacon Hoilis, the Principal, as the person who by his constant hard work had brought the standard of education to the high level that had now been attained by the school. The Bishop then thanked His Highness the Tuan Muda and the Resident for the good wishes expressed by them. He also referred to Archdeacon Hollis as the man who was responsible for the progress of the school. Ho said that for the Jubilee Fund the Committee originally expected to raise a sum of $15,000, but up to date the donations received from the old boys and well-wishers totalled a little more than $5,000 only. As the list is still open, he hoped that those friends who have not yet subscribed would be pleased to contribute something towards the fund. Mr. E. W. Howell. Chairman of the organizing Committee, then rose to give a toast to the guests coupled with the name of the Chief Justice. This was responded to heartily by the old boys present. In reply to the above the Chief Justice said that a short time after his arrival in this country he was asked to serve on the Board of Management as one of the Members of the Committee , it had always been a pleasure to him to be associated with the school in that capacity. To him the night’s function was indeed a double pleasure, as his age happened to coincide with that of the school. Archdeacon Hollis then expressed his sincere thanks for what had been spoken about his work in the school. He ended his speech by requesting everyone to repair to the playing field, where it was proposed to hold other entertainments. VARIETY ENTERTAINMENT. The dinner was followed by a display of fireworks, Torch Drill and Gymnastic Display by the school¬ boys, Malay Ronggeng and Dayak Ajat, all these entertainments taking place on the field. The attractive arch bearing the school colours and symbols and the grandstand were beautifully illuminated with coloured lights, and this spectacular scene drew a tremendous crowd of interested sight¬ seers. The whole show was much appreciated by the guests, and was regarded by all as a filling commemoration of the Jubilee year of the St. Thomas' School. St. Thomas’ School. JUBILEE MEMORIAL FUND. The total has this montie reached $5,799.46 but this is still some way off what we aimed at collecting. If every old boy of St. Thomas’ or friend of the School who has not yet sent a donation would forward something, however small, we should be within sight of the $8,000 which we hoped to set aside for the Bursary Fund, before the end of the year. The Committee gratefully acknowledge the following donations received or promised up to and including October 27th, 1936. St. Joseph’s School Athletic Sports. SATURDAY, OCTOBER 17TH. This meeting was held on the playing fields behind the school from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. and. although the weather was as bad as it could be for the last hour, the greater part of the programme was carried out in bright, and very hot, sunshine. A large number of guests arrived and were accommodated under kajang shelters; two bars and a tea room kept everyone amply supplied with refreshments, and the Constabulary Band played up to their usual excellent standard during the afternoon. His Highness the Tuan Muda and Dayang Anne arrived on the field at 4.15 p.m. Two of the records set up hist year were beaten, and one equalled, Lim Bong Kheng jumped ‘20 feet 4 inches in the Long Jump and Assan, a Davak boy from bintulu. surprised us all in the Pole Vault by beating Vincent Yong and the previous year’s record holder. Lucas Tan. clearing 9 feet 7 inches. In Putting the Shot Vincent Yong equalled the record of 27 feet 5 inches. One of the most successful events was the Tournament or “Cock Fighting", in which small boys, mounted on the backs of older boys, contrived to hurl their opponents to the ground. The final victory of Wee Chong Kee. probably the lightest of the jockeys, was very popular with the spectators. At the conclusion of the prize-giving even the usual short speeches would have been inaudible in the heavy rain. One of the junior boys presented a bouquet to Davang Anne, and Mgr. Hopfgartner said a few words of (hanks to His Highness the Tuan Muda for attending the Meeting and to the Dayang Anne for kindly consenting to distribute the prizes, particularly in the appalling weather which was obviously threatening before their arrival at the field. The following is a list of the winners of each event; the Junior Table Tennis, Old Boys’ and Veterans’ races were abandoned owing to rain : — Chinese National Day. SPORTS MEETING IN KUCHING. In celebration of the Chinese National Day, Double Tenth, the local Chinese Community held their annual Sports Meet on Saturday, October 10th, 1936, on the S.P,G. ground which was kindly placed at their disposal by the Principal of St. Thomas' School. The programme started off in the morning at 9 o’clock when the formal opening ceremony began with the singing of the Chinese National Song by the contestants. The Vice-Chairman of the Organizing Committee, Mr. Ng Siak Kiong, next addressed the gathering, after which the com¬ petitors paraded around the field headed by the Hokien School Band. A group of 50 senior boys smartly dressed in white uniforms performed a new kind of mass drill which took the form of the Chinese art of self- defence, and which presented a brilliant spectacle in the body-movements. This item attracted a good deal of interest among the onlookers. Most of the Junior Events were run off in the morning; the kiddies displayed keen enthusiasm in the sprints, and finished up very close in the short distant races. The afternoon programme, which commenced at two o’clock, took place without any hitch. although the entries for the Girls' Section, Division A, were smaller in number than those of last year. AU the senior competitors had put out (heir best efforts in both field and track events, and records set up by them were gratifying and better than previous ones in spite of the unfavourably soft condition of the ground. As the programme was half-way through, the weather became most threatening, but fortunately the imminent downpour suddenly cleared up. The resultant coolness helped to increase the zeal of the competitors and the interest of the spectators. His Highness the Tuan Muda arrived sharp at 4 p.m. and was received by Mr Tun Sum Guan and Mr. Tan Bak Lim (Chairman) at the gate, and afterwards by Mr. Tan Kui Choon, the Hon. Secretary. On taking his seat at the Grandstand, His Highness was greeted by three loyal bows from the 300 boys, who then gave a mass exhibition of physical drill. These boys were all dressed in white and blue, which are the Chinese National Colours. Among the thousands of interested spectators, the following were present The Venerable the Archdeacon of Sarawak, the Acting Government Secretary, the Secretary for Internal Affairs, the Chief Justice, the Acting Secretary for Chinese Affairs, Mr. G. T. Bates and the DAT Amar. At the conclusion. Mr. Tan Sum Guan asked His Highness to give away the Championship Trophies to the following athletes who had scored the highest points in each division Mr. Khan Ah Chong was then asked to give a speech, which was replied to by His Highness the Tuan Muda who expressed his entire agreement with what Mr. Khan Ah Chong had said about the desirability of creating an esprit de corps among the youths in order to turn them eventually into good citizens. He was much impressed, he said, at the display of the Mass Physical Drill, which was performed by 300 boys, who, he under¬ stood, came from five different schools; such good co-operation among this number of schools was really a thing worthy of great admiration. The meeting concluded with three hearty cheers for His Highness the Rajah and three for His Highness the Tuan Muda. Cricket. A very pleasant game, the finish of which was unfortunately spoilt by rain, was played on Sunday, 18th October/ between the Nondescripts and a European XI. As usual the game started late, a few of the European team not even extend¬ ing to their opponents, who were all ready and waiting at 9 o’clock, the slight-courtesy of turning up in time. The game eventually started at 9.25 a.m. The Nondescripts hatted first and runs came steadily, Soh Fu and Baptist shewing good form. After 50 had been hoisted with only four wickets down Cargill took some quick wickets and the innings closed after an hour and a quarter’s interesting play. Hammond though not flattered by his figures was the best of the European bowlers, some of the others seemed to rely on the great Goddess Luck rather than the more orthodox means of length and finger-spin. The Europeans started off confidently and were well on their way to victory when rain came on heavily. Another ten minutes would probably have, sufficed co finish off the match at the rate runs were coming at. the close, so the late-comers above mentioned had the satisfaction of knowing they had robbed their side of a well-deserved victory. The Nondescripts must be congratulated on the great improvement in their form and Philip Soh Fu and others who have worked so hard to weld them into a side are deserving of great credit. If one might venture a criticism it might be suggested that their running between the wickets and their returning from the field might be improved. The catch which dismissed Pollard was a very well taken one. We look forward to many more just as pleasant games in the future. Second Division News. SEPTEMBER. The. Acting Resident, Second Division, states that two separate reports have been received from Malay traders at Lubok Antu, who have recently been trading in Dutch territory, intimating that some of the rebels are still in Dutch territory; there may be some element of truth in these rumours, and the Dutch authorities have been informed. On the 3rd Mr. Outfield, Acting Resident, left with the Resident, Mr. P. M. Adams, on a visit to Saratok. The Officer-in-Charge, Kalaka. was met at Kabong and accompanied the party to Saratok. All Penghulus were present. It was noted in the Krian that most of the Dayaks were taking very late interest in the preparation of their farms this year, partly, owing to the number of deaths that have occurred from an epidemic Which would appear to be influenza. It is also considered that the Krian arc very well off, and that rubber occupies much of their time to the detriment of their farming, although it is seldom that really bad crops arc obtained. The District Officer, Simanggang, reports that Enggat, a Dayak of Rumah Sampar, Munggu Sawa, Lingga, seriously wounded another Dayak named Lachong of the same house when assaulted by assaulting him with his parang. Enggat is now on remand and also under medical observation. He was discharged a year or two ago from the Constabulary for being mentally unsound. Good burns have been reported throughout the Simanggang district, and in many places rice has been planted and is reported to be growing well. There is every prospect of a good harvest. Fruit trees arc flowering, and there is promise of an average crop. Natives in the Simanggang district have been tapping very little during the month, owing to farming, consequently the bazaar rubber stocks have been small. On the 7th Mr. Shave started collecting figures for experimental tapping and production on one group of gardens at Sabu and at another near the hospital at Simanggang. One small central smoke¬ house has been erected for each group. Mr. Shave proceeded to Belong on the 12th and returned on 18th. Up to date there have been no applications to replant rubber. The m.l. Rentis started leaking badly on the 8th and 9th on returning from Saratok. On the 10th the engineer reported that the white metal pro¬ peller bush had worn and that the propeller shaft was almost worn away at one place. The Rentis was therefore towed to Lingga by the m.l. Sin Kim Suah on the 11th and thence to Kuching by H.H.M.Y. Maimuna on the 20th, for docking and repairs. At 8 a.m. on September 26th, His Highness the Rajah's birthday, a Constabulary Guard of honour gave the royal salute at Simanggang, which was also sounded on the bugle. A salute of 7 guns was then fired. The District Officer. Saribas, states that as in August, comparatively few Dayaks visited the station during September. Exemption and Door Tax collections for 1936 have been good, and but little was outstanding at the end of this month. Land revenue has not come in as well as was expected, but a determined attempt to collect all outstanding dues is being made and it is hoped that after the planting season an increase in revenue will be noticeable. Towards the end of the month the burning of hill farming land in the Saribas district commenced in earnest, and columns of smoke were to be seen in all parts of the Ulu. The results of the bums have not yet been received, but some anxiety is felt as rain fell heavily in the Ulu on the 27th, 29th and 30th and appeared to interrupt burns that were in progress. The following are extracts from a report by Mr. J. C. H. Barcroft. District Officer, Saribas, on a recent tour :— “On August 30th, accompanied by Abang Taha, Native Officer, Pengarah Isek, Penghulu Sujang and Abang Spawi. Village Constable. I left Debak for Dayak houses in the Lakis district. “Heavy rain in the morning delayed my departure and made walking—along greasy tree trunks.—anything but pleasurable. The houses in this district are close together and no less than seven were visited this day. The Dayaks them¬ selves were most hospitable, indeed excessively so, a fact which much delayed our progress and resulted in our party not reaching Muton, where we spent the night, till after dark. “It appeared to me that these Dayaks were well off for farming land, and indeed that several other houses could easily be accommodated in the vicinity. However, it is unlikely that up¬ river Dayaks would consider moving here as there is an entire absence of decent clear rivers or springs, and the country generally is unattractive. “On the 31st we made our way by a circuitous route to N. Inar, arriving there at dusk. A more direct route was possible but I had not been in this district before and was anxious to visit as many houses as possible, and to see for myself what farming land was available. Generally speaking, there is a sufficiency of swamp land, but most of the hilly land is planted with rubber or is sour and unsuitable for padi cultivation; on the whole there is no Shortage of farming land in this dis- trict and a few extra doors might be accom¬ modated here without difficulty. On the 1st we proceeded via Sungei Bayor and Pek to the Ulu Rimbas. arriving there at noon. As some of the older members of our party had felt the strain of 2 1/2 days hard walking, I decided to spend the night al Rumah Awan, Ulu Rimbas. In the afternoon a pig hunt was organized, and if we failed to kill, at least we had a good run for our money. and on the way home one of our party was fortunate enough to shoot a kijang. which provided a most welcome addition to the larder. “That night Dayaks from other houses in the neighbourhood collected at Rumah Awan. Several small cases were settled and the intricacy of Rubber Restriction were discussed into the early hours of the morning. “The following day we proceeded overland to N. Ulai, arriving there about four in the afternoon. The day’s walk was over low hills in fanning land, and as we proceeded further down river I observed a shortage of sizable timber and a general deterioration in farming land. “On the 3rd we proceeded down river by boat, but within half an hour of starting we were brought to a dead stop by a solid block of driftwood, and were forced to abandon our boat and proceed on foot to Debak. At this time of the year the upper Rimbas, where still tidal, cannot be navigated even by the smallest of boats. Several attempts have been made to induce the natives to clear the river of driftwood but without any success. Apparently they are deterred not so much by the magnitude of the task as by superstition: the story goes that many years ago the Balan Dayaks sent an expedition to attack the Malays and Dayaks in the Rimbas. This attack was defeated by the wisdom of a certain Malay, who, invoking supernatural powers, succeeding in filling the Riinbas with driftwood and thus preventing the pirates reaching their objective. To this day both Malays and Dayaks believe that any attempt to remove this driftwood must result in misfortune and probably death for those who undertake the task. “On the 4th I returned overland to Spaoh and boated up to Betong.' The Officer-in-Charge, Kalaka, reports that in the Resident's Court on September 5th Lumpoh anak Mut and Aban anak Gellaw were sentenced to two years R.T. each under Section 436 of the Penal Code. In the District Court. Saratok, Lim Guan Seng and Ong Boon Thay, both Hokien coolies of Local Sago factory, were charged under the Opium Regulations. The former was lined $25 or in default ‘2 months for smoking Government chandu without a pass-book, and was sentenced to six weeks’ R.T. for offering an illegal gratification; the latter was fined $25. During the month a number of up-river hawkers were prosecuted for breaches of Local Orders, namely building langkaus at Dayak landing stages for the purpose of trading, and fined $5 each. Two cases under the Rubber Restriction Order, viz., failing to surrender rubber Census forms and illicit tapping of rubber trees during holiday, vide Notifications 429 and 579/36 respectively, were beard. The accused in the first case was fined $5 and costs and the second acquitted. When Penghulu Uudum arrived at meet the Resident at the beginning of he apologised for his sketchy attire Saratok to the month and then explained how his prahu had been capsized by the bore at Rantau Kamidan, about an hour's paddle above the bazaar. The Dayaks say they do not remember ever encountering a bore of such magni¬ tude so far up river; the river has been exceptionally low owing to the prolonged drought. Third Division News. SEPTEMBER. A Hokien Chinese named Bay Mah Tee was sentenced in the Resident’s Court, Sibu, to five years imprisonment for having committed house¬ breaking by night in order to commit theft. This man. a coolie engaged by the contractor effecting repairs to Song Fort, climbed into the Fort on the night of July 21st, 1936, opened the safe by means of a wire or skeleton key, and thus obtained Government cash amounting to $815. He was traced through an informer, however, and cash to the value of $778.80 was recovered. On September 1st a Dayak named Layang was sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment, subject to confirmation by the Supreme Court, for the attempted murder of a Foochow Chinese at Pasai, in the Igan river. Layang pleaded that the reason for his crime was a dream in which a spirit appeared and threatened him with insanity if he did not take a life: thia desire to kill, he stated, was supplemented by the fact that when he saw rhe Chinese he felt a sudden urge to kill him. He and the Chinese were strangers to each other. It is possible that Layang’s real motive was robbery. An inquest was hold, at Igan, into the death of Haji Matassan, Tua Kampong of Igan. The deceased, who was an old man, was found lying unconscious on a bridge, with bruises on his head, having apparently fallen and injured himself while returning, at night from a panggilan. He died shortly afterwards. A verdict of death by misadventure was recorded. Accompanied by Datu Abang Haji Mohidin, the District Officer, Sibu, proceeded to Igan in s.l. Chamois on September 9th in connection with the election of a new Tua Kampong. The election took place on the 10th. resulting in Smail bin Musim being offered the appointment. Five extra Rubber Restriction Inspectors were engaged for the Third Division as from September 1st, and one clerk Two Rubber Restriction Checker-Supervisors arrived from Kuching, and were provided with a staff of six checkers each, locally, and have now commenced operations at Kanowit and Engkilo, where they are checking the production of selected holdings. During the month, five convictions were obtained in the Courts for planting rubber under Order No. R—3, and 19 convictions for offences committed by rubber dealers under Order No. R—4. With the increased staff it has Loen possible to increase the number of patrols, and a considerable amount of useful work has been done, particularly in connection with rubber stencils. Enormous numbers of incorrect or illegible "home-made’' copies of original stencils are in use locally. A number of prosecutions were instituted, and as a result holders of badly made or incorrect stencils have voluntarily appeared in large numbers to exchange these. The Divisional Forest Officer returned to Sibu on September 15th after having accompanied Mr. R. Gotte to the Pala Wong district. Mr. Gotte has been engaged by Messrs, the Borneo Com- pany Ltd., to report on the forests of Sarawak. A small sawmill has been opened at Bukit Lan. The Divisional Forest Officer reports that it is of the usual haphazard variety, and the small engine used is continually giving trouble. Seventy tons of timber is being worked on the Bukit Lan reserve to be used on the roof of the new Sibu Hospital. The total Land ami Survey revenue for the Third Division for August amounted to $7,609.10 as compared with $8,428.99 for the corresponding month of the previous year. The collection for Sibu district for the month amounted to $2,071.72 shewing a decrease of approximately $1,698.23 as compared with the corresponding month of the previous year. 105 titles for 518 acres (approximate) were issued and forwarded to various stations, being 64 pay¬ able for 365 acres and 41 free for 153 acres. 60 titles for 587 acres (approximate) were can¬ celled consisting of 59 payable for 584 acres and 1 free land for 3 acres. The Assistant Superintendent of Lands left Sibu on the 9th to visit Dalat, Oya. Mukah, Balingian, and returned on the 16th. The survey of the Sibu Bazaar was completed during the month, but a number of titles on the Island still await survey On September 26th, HIs Highness the Rajah’s birthday, all Government offices at Sibu were closed, and the flagstaff and launches were 'dressed.' At 8.0 a.m. a salute of 21 guns was fired from the Fort Battery; at 9.0 a.m. a Guard of Honour under the command of Mr. W. L. P. Sochon, paraded at the Fort flagstaff. The District Officer. Mr. R. E. Le Sueur, in the absence of the Resident, inspected the Guard of Honour and then presented Long Service Deco¬ rations and medals. The presentation was followed by three cheers for His Highness tin? Rajah. All European Officers and their families were present as well as a large crowd representative of the Malay, Chinese and Dayak communities. Among visitors to Sibu during the month were Mr. A. Macpherson from Meluan. Mr. and Mrs. Kidd of Kanowit, the Rev. Father V. Shelley, Mrs. Goldie from Miri and Mr. Cordiner of the Sarawak Electricity Supply Company. During September, three Dayaks were convicted of tuba fishing in the Sarikei river and were sentenced to two months’ imprisonment. An outbreak of influenza and pneumonia in Rumah Sampai, near Selalang, was responsible for ten deaths. No reports were received from the Penghulu, though the Dayaks had deserted their village in fear of the epidemic. The Ravelling Dresser visited the village and distributed medicines. The travelling Dresser also visited the ulu Bina- tang, where Penghulu Ajah was suffering from dysentery. The District Officer, Lower Rejang, reports that although Dayaks were supposed to be busy burn¬ ing and planting up their farms, a good number of them found time to come down for cartridges, and other minor matters. An interesting case of selabat was brought down from the ulu Sarikei. Two Dayaks who had a petty dispute about the ownership of a fighting cock refused to bring their case before the Tuai or Penghulu, and insisted on drinking each other's blood from incisions in the arm. The expected result of this procedure was the speedy death of the man who was not telling the truth, but neither party has as yet shown any ill effects. Both parties were warned against repeating such practices, and were ordered to deposit pledges for good behaviour. Penghulu Umpor, of the Julau-Sungai, now under control of this district, made his first official visit to Sarikei and reported tuba fishing in the Sungai. This case will be heard on the spot by the Dislrict Officer on his visit co the Sungai in early November. Very little pepper is being shipped from Sarikei and Binatang owing to continued low prices. The District Officer, Kapit, reports that on September 2nd Penghulu Manok Manchal was fined $100 for holding a tuba fishing; this news has now spread round the whole district and is having an excellent effect. On September 19th two Chinese were fined $50 each at Kapit for being in possession of Govern¬ ment chandu, not being registered smokers or authorized agents. The Kayan wife of a Kapit Chinese trader was also fined $30 for being in possession of more than twice the amount of chandu last entered in her pass-book. In all these three cases the chandu was discovered in a boat en route, for Belaga where it is known that a con¬ siderable amount of illicit dealing in chandu takes place. Incidentally, the Chinese admitted that the chandu was brought up from Sibu on a launch, but they refused to divulge the name of the seller. A Sibu Hokien hawker was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment at Kapit for cheating, his method of operation being to accept monetary advances on a young child of his, promising to give the child in adoption and later refusing to do so; this happened both at Song and Kapit. The natural mother of the child, a Sibu Dayak, is now being sought for to come to some proper arrange¬ ment for its future. Penghulus Jugah, Sibat. Manok Manchal and Ugak visited Kapit during the month, and Peng¬ hulus Sirai, Briak and Bedimbab visited Song. Dayaks have almost finished planting out in the Kapit district and good reports have been received. Engkabang is flowering profusely, and high hopes of a bumper crop are entertained, although naturally prospects are uncertain as the fruit has not yet set. The following are extracts from a report by the District Officer, Kapit:— "During my tour of Penghulu Ansi's district I paid a visit to the camp of Mr. Gotte, the Borneo Co., Ltd., timber expert in Sungei Preraran Kiri, Ulu Sungei Merit. He reports chat so far prospects are excellent, and timber well above the average; keladan and kapor are present in great quantities, but unfortunately there is no keruing. At the time of my visit he was about to move camp to Nanga Tanyit. further up the Merit. I took Penghulu Ansi with me and several arrangements were made in connection with Mr. Gotte's labour force, now totalling 34 coolies. This venture of the B.C.L. is exciting great interest among the Dayaks, and I have been inundated with questions on the subject. It is Significant that even with burning and planting in progress, a period when normally labour is scarce, many applicants for work with the com¬ pany have had to be turned away.” In the course of a trip to the ulu, the District Officer, Kapit. and party found a large pig in midstream lifting attacked by a small crocodile about four feet long. The crocodile escaped, but the pig was speared, one boat being almost swamped during the excitement. There was little crime in the Nanga Meluan district during September. Nyanggau organised a big tuba fishing in the Poi, and all headmen con¬ cerned have been fined. The following are extracts from a report by the District Officer, Nanga Meluan :— ''Dayaks are busy burning, and those up river have started planting. The Dayak sawah farms round Kanowit were inspected. The two Dusun demonstrators have made specimen ploughs and have ploughed a demonstration plot near Rumah Empam; changkol’d farms will again be made in the Tuah and in the Kanowit. It is grati¬ fying to note that the Dayaks fully realise that a sawah farm cannot be made in a hurry, and are continuing to stump and to improve the drainage of their plots in addition to farming in the old way. The Dayaks who have taken up this method will be put into communal reserves, but it is a pity that they will not take out indi¬ vidual titles to their land. Those who have no 'pesaka' are being urged to take up these titles, but they are most reluctant to pay even 20 cents per acre quit rent for such land. "Security of tenure is essential to the success of this sawah padi farm experiment, and it seems impossible to convince the Dayaks of this. Until they learn from bitter experience the necessity of secured individual tenure they naturally will remain averse from adding to their taxation. "The process of learning will, I think, prove unpleasant both to the Dayaks and to the Adminis¬ tration, and for this reason I submit that it is to be regretted that free titles cannot be issued for permanently cultivated padi land as for sago. "Temporary married and bachelor quarters were built by Constabulary at Meluan, and a temporary house for the. dresser was built by the Village Constable. The difficulty of erecting permanent buildings at Meluan is very great. I strongly recommend that at present only temporary buildings be built. If three carpenters are engaged when sufficient timber to start building has been delivered, permanent bouses for the Junior Service could gradually be built as permanent necessity for them is proved, and I further recommend that this expenditure be spread over as long a period as may prove expedient. Until a road to Meluan from Binatang or Sarikei is built, heavy expenditure on development will prove to he ill-advised, except in the unlikely event of more Dayak unrest in the near future. "Meluan can justify its existence by insuring that there is no further unrest, but the Fort and garrison alone is sufficient to do this. If the intention is to start a station which will have a civilising influence on the Kanowit Dayaks, however, it must also become a trade-centre, and this it cannot be unless proper communications are provided.” In a storm of rare violence a big tree was blown down at Meluan. falling on the Constabulary bachelors’ temporary quarters. No lives were lost, though one man was hurt. Some damage was done to their private property. The price of sago at Mukah rose to 69 cents per pasu and maintained an average of 55 cents all the month. A bamboo groin was planted in the Mukah river at right angles to the bank above the blubor site erosion, and is reported to be diverting the current into midstream to a certain extent. Visitors to Mukah during September included Messrs. Cordiner and Bormond of the Sarawak Electricity Supply Co., Dr. De Raaf of Sarawak Oilfields, Ltd., Mr. S. G. Hansom, Assistant District Officer. Sibu, Mr. G. A. C. Field. Superin¬ tendent of Shipping, Sibu, Mr. G. Farelly, Superintendent of Surveys. Sibu, Mr. B. Summers, Superintendent of Lands, Sibu, Mr. J. C. B. Fisher, District Officer. Oya, Mr. F. H. Pollard, Secretary for Native Affairs and Mr. A. G. Taylor. Auditor. • The mail contractor started carrying mails to and from Sibu to Mukah from September 1st. This is a great benefit, as although Government and other launches have, as a matter of chance, plied fairly regularly with Sibu carrying visitors and officers on duty during the summer, this irregular service was unexpected in all cases, and cannot lie relied on. and during the landas is practically non existent. On September 10th, it was reported that Sebah binti Meh. a Melanau woman of Kampong Kuala, Oya, had been missing from her home all day. At 5 p.m. her body was found in a ditch in Day’s Road. At an inquest held on 11th a verdiet of death by heart failure caused by exhaustion was returned, Deceased had been in failing health for some months and was considered by local people to be "queer in the head.” The District Officer. Oya and Dalat. states that Penghulu Untol and T.R. Lumbok of the Ulu Oya reported at Dalat on September 16th that Rumah Lumbok had been burnt to the ground in August by the carelessness of a woman who upset a lamp at a time when the house was deserted. All the property of the sixteen doors is said to have been destroyed, but there was no loss of life. Untol reported all well in his district. Dayaks have had good burns in most cases and were busy planting, etc., during the month, Melanau fishing was in full swing, and quite good catches were obtained. Reports, from the Ulu Oya state that engkabang trees (illipe nuts) are flowering very well again this year. Melanaus who are owners of sago gardens were urged to clear their holdings of undergrowth, in order to give bears, pigs, etc., as little cover as possible. Some fifty vegetables plots of various sizes were laid out by the school-boys at Oya under the direction of Abang Dillah. Headmaster. These plots arc close to the school building, and great care has been taken to prepare the ground in the proper way. Seeds have been supplied and planted. The demonstration vegetable garden at Oya is doing satisfactorily, though it has been found necessary to use tuba to keep down worms and other pests. The price of raw sago in the Oya District reached the highest level of the year during September, the prices at Dalat being 75 cents per passu, and the Kut 85 cents. The amount of raw sago exported from the district showed an increase over the figures for last month, the amount being :— Total increase on the figures for last month—118 koyans. Five motor schooners, four motor launches, four sailing schooners and twenty-six bandongs cleared Oya during the month, the total tonnage being 777 tons, an increase on the figures for last month of 108 tons. MUKAH. PRODUCE AND CRAFTS EXHIBITION 1936. This exhibition was held on the Padang at Mukah on His Highness the Rajah’s birthday, the principal objects being to encourage agriculture and lay its varied possibilities before local natives: to improve their stock by competition, example and the use of prize animals at stud; and to revive the many local arts, crafts and industries which are in danger of dying out in a bicycle-ridden age (the bicycles, incidentally, being usually ridden. by patchouli-scented youths with flapping trousers and dark spectacles, whose source of revenue is a mystery until one looks in the towkay's account book). Large crowds of kampong people and visitors came in the day before, and the Committee had a busy tune receiving the exhibits. In the evening the first of two free cinema shows was staged on the Padang, which was covered by a mass of spectators. On the morning of the "big day” huge crowds had re assembled on the Padang as early as 6.30 a.m., the crisp early morning sun flashing cheerfully on bright sarongs and on the gaily- coloured models, flowers and fruit which were being brought in for the show. Presently the burbling of the crowds, the quack¬ ing, gabbling and crowing of quantities of ducks, geese, fowls and turkeys died down, (yea, even the poultry fell silent) as a squad of the Sarawak Constabulary, under Inspector Abang Ali, came to the halt smartly in line opposite a special flag-staff in the centre of the show grounds. A word of command and the smart click of the "present” were heard, as punctually at 8.0 a.m. the flag was broken at the mast-head to the muffled roar of the guns firing the Royal Salute from Fort Burdett. The salute was taken by the District Officer, the band playing the Sarawak Anthem, followed by three hearty cheers for His Highness the Rajah, led by the Inspector. A moment's silence and the babble and burble of the crowd renewed itself and while the “hoi polloi” proceeded to admire the exhibits and spend their spare cents at the coconut shy and the hoop-la. the judges set about their unenviable task of judging no fewer than 405 very varied exhibits. The main exhibition shed (8O'xl5') was too small by half but everything was got in somehow, and there was still room to creep round the gang¬ ways. A long wide shelf bisected by a wall ran down the centre, underneath which were compart¬ ments wired in for poultry, each space being filled with brightly plunged and long-tailed game cocks, sleek hens, turkeys, geese, ducks and even a pair of white brok monkeys exhibited by Mr. Jack Douglas, Court. Writer, Dalat. The tuneful cacophony of the birds made con¬ versation difficult, but nevertheless added to the general atmosphere of ramai ramai. Above the cages the shelves were overflowing with huge striped pumpkins, clusters of fat purple egg plant, long streaky snake gourds, huge bunches of enormous bananas, rows of red pinang, greens of all sorts and colossal polished coconuts. krebang and keladek. etc. Further along were the models and carvings, occupying almost the whole length of one side of the shed by themselves. There were 56 entries of models and 27 of carvings, 27 frogs, rats, eats, crocodiles, monkeys, etc., perpetuated in wood, the palm for which went to Giyu of Dalat for two beautifully-worked idols two feet, high in natural light wood (varnished, they would be improved by linseed polish only). They were exhibited by Mr. Fisher, District Officer, Oya. The 2nd prize went to Ahmat bin Langun for a very if -like bird made of a buffalo horn. The 1st prize-winning model was a superb barong made by Juragan Tuto of Mukah, in nature coloured wood (varnished) and complete down to the smallest accessory including idus (net) baskers, floats, anchors, paddles. boathook. and even the crew’s rations. It is a great pity that most local model makers and carvers use hideously clashing rods, greens, and yellows, which, though making a fine splash of colour taken together in a show, look hideous individually and are not true to life. This barong was a pleasing exception. The 2nd prize went to Zenui binti Hamdani for a most intricate working model suri tenun, or cloth-weaving loom. In addition, owing to the high quality and quantity of the remainder, 6 special prizes were awarded to some very neat model sago-working sheds and some model jerunai or sulong (commonly called totem poles). There were also some beautifully worked and polished specimens in the paddles section, at which local people (especially Dalat) excel. Also some very fine gold-threaded and locally worked sarongs, and other things too numerous to describe in detail. The Rev. Father Win. Boon took 1st prize for some hens' eggs the size of a duck’s best effort, and the quality of the poultry was astonishingly high considering the stringy walking skeletons that we always meet on the kampong toads and in the markets. Mr. Lau Theng Kheng of the District Office walked off with the 1st prize in the Melanau and Chinese poultry sections with two pairs of fine birds, and Mr. W. Chua Tamby took the 2nd prize for the Chinese breed section. In the Melanau breed section, the 2nd prize was shared by Mr. W. Chua Tamby and Tua Kampong Reba. Taken together, the whole lot made a very fine show, dozens of models and pots of flowers lining the gangways and every inch of Space being taken up. and there still being an overflow on the Padang. Some excellent sheet rubber was shown, the 1st prize being divided between Bian Seng and Bakir for some quite flawless amber-like sheets and some fine while lamanta won 1st and 2nd prizes for Kuna bin Budin and Seran (of Kampong Eward, Tillian). Mr. Ong Kee Hui, Agricultural Assistant, was in charge of a large number of most varied and interesting exhibits including a prize Berkshire Boar (which has been left behind for stud to improve local stock). The other exhibits of the Agricultural Department were housed in a special stall, and if the natives could only be interested (and they undoubtedly were in many cases) there appear to be great and varied opportunities dis¬ closed by these exhibits, among which were a model smoke house for rubber, a copra kiln and a full size "Night Ark" for poultry (in which great interest in being taken), huge round purple egg plants, enormous keladi, yams, krebang, and arrow-root; soap made in Sarawak by Mr. J. Scott and others, beautiful dahlias and seeds galore of coffee. tea. cotton. millets, tobacco and gingelly, etc.; sauces, oils, dyes, extracts, and apparently all the species of the East, grown or produced in Sarawak. Nearly all these seeds, vegetables, and models were kindly presented to the District Office by the Agricultural Department., and they arc being dis- tributed amongst Government Officers and the prison and school gardens, and some of the seeds and the models will he kept in stock for the use and edification of the above gardens and the public. The Honorary Secretary and Committee of the show would like to take this opportunity to thank the Senior Agricultural Officer and his Assistant. Mr. Ong Kee Hui, for the enormous amount of trouble they must have taken in preparing, send- ing up and arranging these exhibits. There was a model poultry farm on show (con¬ structed almost entirely by Mukah prisoners) composed of a mam run enclosed by a tarred bamboo stake fence about 35 yards square, with a small fattening compartment, a brood pen, nest boxes made of kerosene oil tins, a night house, perches and dropping boards, broody coop, grit and drv mash hoppers, etc. A Light Sussex Cock, two Rhode Island Red hens and a brood of chicks were exhibited in it by Mr. L G. Anderson, and another brood of chicks in charge of a capon from the 12th mile Agricul- tural Station. this capon is trained (adding insult to injury by making the “armpits" slightly sore and placing the chicks there overnight. The soothing effect of the chicks apparently induces a feeling of mother-love in the luckless capon, thus fooled into pseudo-motherhood. The operation is especially useful commercially as it enables the brood hen to return to laying directly after the hatch. A certain visitor, however, to whom the process was explained bent his brow in an angry frown, remarking that this 'muckin' about with nature" oughtn't to be allowed. However, the capon is happier this way. with something to occupy its lonely life. Incidentally, we are not ashamed to confess that a 25-cent ticket lottery, with this farm (and 3 birds) as 1st prize (won by Soon Seng) all the sheds used in the show and $5 as 2nd and 3rd prizes (won by Awi bin Kladir and Lamang), realised a profit of $50 or so for the show funds. One of the brightest spots was the St. Anthony's convent stall, full of beautifully-worked table cloths, and other needle work which gained several prizes, most realistic paper flowers, as well as live ones and the largest tomatoes ever seen in Mukah (the King Pin of these died a few weeks before the show but was mummified in vinegar). Local headmen were taken round on a tour and all the instructional exhibits were explained to them, as well as the cultivation of the prison demonstration garden standing crops of jagong, krebang, sword bean and soya bean, all of which ran be grown locally without trouble in poorish soil. Meanwhile, the boys from the 3 local Schools, (the Mission, Datu Awang Udin and Chong Boon Schools) had been competing feverishly in the sports—there were inter-school team races in the relay, tug-of-war, sack race, obstacle race, high jump. long jump and 100 yards, etc., the R.C. Mission School being 1st on points, Malay School 2nd, and Chinese School 3rd. These sports were very ably organised and super¬ vised by the Rev. Father A. Mulder and the Rev. Wm. Boon, assisted by the headmasters of the other schools, and they proved a great draw for the public. Another tremendously popular event was the knock-out football competition, the final of which was played oil on the 25th and resulted in a win for the Tillian team by 1 goal to ml the runners up being the King Kong team. Five teams, (inclu¬ ding a S.O.L. team) competed,—all the matches were played on the very excellent Mission ground by courtesy of the Rector, the Rev. A. G. Mulder, and huge crowds attended each match. At midday over 60 people foregathered in the Fort, for a curry, at which the health of His High¬ ness the Rajah was proposed by the District Officer and drunk by all present. A curry-making competition produced only two entries, trial of which inflated the exhausted judges to bursting point and they awarded a dead heat: (had there been more than two entries, there would have been a few dead beat judges in a "dead heat" also, no doubt) 1st prize was divided between Mr. W. Chua Tamby and Haji Hashim. This ‘blow-out' completed, the judges stalked forth to the wharf to award 1st prize to Fakir bin Rasam for a beautiful yellow painted barong, 1st prize for bundongs to Marmina. mid for prahus to Pati bin Sam. Then came the jala throwing competition (rather badly timed perhaps) which was won by Lai bin Aim who flung a tremendous net of at least 4 fathoms in an almost perfect circle. Mr. J. G. Anderson had a small stall in which were shown some Rhode Island Red Light Sussex cross pullets and cockerels reared on soya bean, padi bran and prawn refuse (dry mash; 4 dozen eggs in a specially designed box with a rotating base which will keep eggs fresh for 1 month by daily rotation; a quantity of soya bean grown locally with products made from it, and a sago grinding machine worked on the circular saw principle, with a bicycle crank and chain, and designed to speed up sago grinding and to replace the old 'to and from' parut method. The total cost of the machine is two or three dollars. Eventually the evening began to close in, and with the dusk, the Committee and Judges, etc., repaired to the Fort for the draw of the lottery and the prize giving. Mrs. J. G. Anderson presented the winners and runners up of the Football competition with (heir medals, and the winners of the badminton com- petition with their prizes (1st prize W. O. Ham¬ dan. 2nd Tan Cheng Hoon) but as very few of the other prize-winners bad turned up, the main prize giving was postponed to the following day and a large party proceeded to a Chinese dinner kindly given by Towkay Sim Liang Ho. Eventually $320 worth of prizes were distri¬ buted. being $170 in excess of advertised prize money, owing to the unexpected quantity and excellence of the exhibits. Darkness had now fallen, and everyone returned to the Padang which was beautifully illuminated with fairy lights by the kindness of Messrs. Sarawak Electricity Supply Company, Ltd. The old Malay Court house had been decorated and converted into ft bar: in front of this building a fountain played over a small pool filled with gold fish and Oya water lilies and an ornamental garden planted with sago palms, the whole of which was floodlit. A firework display (ably managed by Inspector Abang Ali) added to the excitement, and the crowd (already vast) by now increased to about 4,000 people all massed together and seated on the Padang in anticipation of the open air Cinema Show timed for 8.45 p.m, Roth shows were excellent, especially Charlie Chaplin, the last of the silent heroes, beloved of the natives. During the interval a main, jimpin contest was held, four couples competing on the grass in front of the main grandstand which was again illumi- nated by the S.E.S. Co.’s welcome beams. 1st prize was awarded to Sahari and Narwi. 2nd to Idi and Osman, and two special prizes to Bagek and Bujang as all four couples were extremely neat on their feet. a nut (so beloved of English fair grounds) for the less easily obtainable tin of fruit or cigarettes. This showman must have been a juggler in his spare time, for an indignant judge (off duty at last found a cigarette end in a tin of "lai chee” which he knocked off the peg. A babble of conversation coming from the bar behind the floodlit fountain was the next attraction, added to by the thought of a mug of cold ale (" that sinful drink which biteth like a serpent and stingeth like a ruddy adder” according to P. G. Wodehouse's converted pugilist, at which the famous Freddie remarked that he’d been looking for bear like that for years). Inside were another brace of judges holding post-mortems over the prize pumpkin (“the one that reminded me of my aunt Lucie doing cross- words”). One of these judges, (a gentleman afflicted with a bamboo shoot-phobia) developed, in addition, a serious attack of pingpongomania (or the fear of being mistaken for a table tennis court) by insisting up to the last ditch that the Rev. Mother Alphonsus bad won the 1st prize for her tennis court and bad gone so far as to drug the other judge to took at this exhibit which turned out (when viewed by the nonphobia judge) to be a particularly fine table cloth. Presently a sound of clapping broke out from the Padang, and the show was over ; ushered out (as it was ushered in) by another prolonged shower of rockets and fireworks and the shuffling and murmuring of the vast crowds. In conclusion. sufficient thanks cannot be given to the judges. Fathers Anthony Mulder and Win. Boon and Messrs. Fisher, Field, Farrelly, Hansom, Pengiran Haji Mohamat, Abang Mustapha and Mr. Sim Liang Ho for their untiring activity and the intelligence and thoroughness of their awards. Thanks also are due to the many others who helped the Committee, in various ways. It is hoped to make the show an annual event, and the next date will almost certainly be fixed for May 23rd and 24th, Proclamation Day, the judges having demanded two days next time. —J. G. ANDERSON. Fourth Division News. SEPTEMBER A reward of $30 was offered by the Borneo Evangelical Mission at Limbang for information leading to the conviction of the offender in case of theft of cash from the Mission building up river, which occurred some months ago. No clues have yet been discovered. The death of Liew Shun, a subsidized pepper planter, Panderuan road, was investigated, and a verdict of suicide was returned. Deceased had swallowed nicotine essence used for spraying the vines. The District Officer, Limbang, reports that the health of the district has been good, with the exception of a reported epidemic up river of what appears to be pneumonia, from which many deaths have occurred. The dresser is proceeding up river to investigate, and at the same time to advise the natives of the necessity of vaccinations, which have not been undertaken for many years in this area. An apparent vagrant was admitted to Limbang hospital, and found to be a victim of morphinism. How he has been able to obtain cash to purchase his regular supply of three tubes a day is still a mystery. Up-river Agent Jaya returned from a tour of the ulu Lubai and Panderuan areas on the 4th and reported everybody still busy in their farms plant¬ ing padi. In the Sungei Sebena, Pati Medamit, the stream was reported to be choked with dead fish which, it appears, were killed by heavy rain-water flooding freshly burned off padi farms, the water being black with timber ashes. Penghulu Belulok. a pure Tabun from the Baram side, with a local Murut wife, was warned not to try and initiate in the ulu Limbang, with¬ out prior reference to the District Officer, pure Tabun udat to which the ulu Limbang tribes may not be accustomed. Intermarriage of the various local tubes in the ulu Limbang has been common for many years, and the recent endeavours to com- pile and record local tribal adat show that Muru and Tabun adat are practically identical in ulu Limbang. There only remain a handful of pure Tabuns now in the ulu Limbang, nevertheless their adat, have been adopted by Muruts, who although more degenerate, are numerically superior. The instancee referred to arose when Belulok’s daughter married a Dayak according to the Tabun Murut adat of the wife, which is quite customary. At the subsequent divorce, however, the Dayak husband denied the one sengau or tutok human clause in the Tabun Murut marriages adat which is purely Tabun, although it is now clear that he bad understood and agreed to it publicly before marriage. According to this adat. the husband voluntarily provides a tawak, on which husband and wife sit during the marriage feast; this gift is quite seperate from any brian and reverts to their child, irrespective of any subsequent divorce of whatever nature. Failing a child, it reverts to the wife only, and cannot over be reclaimed by the husband.” This particular marriage adat is not altogether unknown in the ulu Limbang amongst the very few remaining pure Tabuns, but is very uncommon in the pure Murut, or the much more frequent mixed marriages. It has now been ordered that in future any adoption of the sengau clause by a husband must be reported to Govern¬ ment bv both parties and recorded before the marriage takes place, otherwise the lawak will be held to be part of the brian in case ci a divorce. T.K. Jebair, who came in to Limbang for medical attention, reported that a boy aged 14 and his brother aged 30 were upset from a boat by a crocodile, which grabbed the boy. who was pad¬ dling in the stern. The elder brother wrestled with the crocodile, which only, released the boy when the latter managed to gouge out one of its eyes. They both managed to gain the bank alive. Litigation at Lawas was negligible during the month. The one criminal case was of an unusual nature: fabrication of false evidence. A con¬ viction was obtained. The Officer-in-Charge, Lawas, reports with regret the death at the ripe old age of 98 of Datu Pengiran Haji Mohamat, of Trusan. He per¬ formed long and faithful service to Government, a term of 38 years in all, and his name is one that that will be long remembered. Born (it is said !) in the year 1839, it is not only interesting but frankly staggering to think that he arrived in the world in the same year that Sir James Brooke first set foot on Sarawak territory. The late Datu was a native of Simanggang, but in the year 1884 he was requested by the Second Rajah to move with his relatives to Trusan and take up permanent residence there. This accounts for the fact pure Sarawak Malay is still regularly spoken in a part of the country otherwise populated by Brunei Malays. He was raised to the rank of Datu in the year 1916, and retired from the Service in 1929. The Lawas (Sarawak) Estates. Limited, exported 32,704 lbs. of dry rubber during the month. The District Officer. Baram. reports that two Chinese from his station are now in Miri hospital with typhoid. They were both accustomed to feed in the bazaar and it is thought, that they must have become infected there. Precautions have been taken and a daily inspection takes place so that anyone suspected may be isolated at once The unsavoury condition of the back of the bazaar. especially drainage from the numerous pigsties, is very insanitary and should be dealt with as soon as possible. A scheme for improvement is being sent in, and it is hoped that authority to order the removal of squatters huts, pigsties, and smoke¬ houses to lots already surveyed will be obtained. A young Malay leper from Kampong Dagang was sent to Kuching, and another child, a Kenyah. has been found to have positive smears. This girl was born in Kuching some six years ago in the Leper Camp but apparently was not infected. She was sent back to be eared for by relations in the Tutoh and now after all these years the disease has only just developed. Her father is still alive in the Leper Camp, but her mother died there some years ago. $3,049.60 of the Baram Relief Fund was spent at the end of the month, but some hundred and fifteen bags of rice will be required by natives already waiting in the bazaar. A supplementary vote for $5,000 has been applied for. Only two applications for relief have come from villages between Long Akah and Leo Main, and one from the Tinjar. It is not yet known how the rice substitutes continually planted are doing in these districts, and whether the inhabitants will be able to exist on these until the next harvest without having relief. The Lepu Tau at Long Muh, it is said, will be able to do so. Even when these people from the headwaters of the Baram do arrive and ask for relief, it is a matter for conjecture whether the rice will ever reach the village, since with the river and the rapids against them they might be held up for weeks at a time. Reports of the new crop to hand so far are very discouraging. Several fields of newiy planted rice have been destroyed by pests (gioh) and mice. The Resident , Fourth Division, comments on the Baram famine as follows :— "With regard to the alleged famine in the ulu Baram, while there certainly is a shortage of rice, and apparently a serious one, it is difficult to deter¬ mine what share of this misfortune is due io the people themselves, and how much is due to unforseen calamities. It is significant that the Kelabits in the far ulu and the Dayaks in the Bakong, Niah, Sibuti and neighbouring districts do not appear to be seriously affected. The District Officer, Bintulu, mentions in this month's report that the Kayans in his district are later than the Dayaks in planting. It appears that Kayans and Kenyahs have so many pantang that forbid them to approach their farms at certain times that neglect is followed by pests. One thing is very evident, however, and that is the futility of simply paying out relief money without attempting a remedy. Last year Government paid nut about $1,000, (his year $5,000 and the District Officer wants $5,000 more. What will the natives want in 1937. 1938 and 1939? If, as I suspect, much of the famine is due to neglect by the natives themselves, then they must lie shown that God helps those that help themselves ! The whole matter is being investigated.” The Resident. Fourth Division, accompanied by the Divisional Treasurer, arrived at Baram by m. v. Margaret on September 11th. and returned to Miri on the 14th. Particular attention was paid to the pauper settlement nt the back of the bazaar, and the scheme for improvement was discussed. The weekly visit to Bakong by the District Officer. Baram, will cease on the 15th of next month and one month’s warning has been given to those residing in the Bakong river. It is felt that there is insufficient business there to warrant the expen¬ diture resultant on a weekly visit, and there is no reason why the Chinese living at Bakong. Kuala Nyabor, and Beluru should not come to Marudi to do their business and purchase chandu in the same manner as the Chinese from the other up-river bazaars. Lobok Nibong bazaar continues to flourish and to he a very painful thorn in the side of the Marudi traders. Complaints are continual, but the matter has been thrashed out and a decision given by His Highness the Rajah. They are told this time and time again, but it docs not appear to help or do any good. Padi planting in the Bintulu District is reported to be finished by most natives. The Kayans, how¬ ever. seem to be behind everybody else. The District Officer. Bintulu. reports as follows “The Native Officer of Tatau reported to me that a tuba-fishing had taken place in the Anap. The facts were not known until I got to Tatau to investigate the case. It appears that two tuai- rumah, Berai and Buli, had called an aum and discussed the Government Tuba Regulations. They agreed that these constituted a gross inter¬ ference with their customs, and decided to hold a large tuba-fishing in the Anap; messengers were then sent all over the river giving the date (four days after the aum) : they said that they would hold the fishing and Government could do what it liked afterwards. The tuba-fishing was duly held, and most, but not all, tuai-tuai rumah attended it. This did not reach the Penghulus’ ears until after the event. Our system of having our Penghulus within easy reach of the Fort, fails here, as perhaps if we had had a Penghulu in the upper Anap the whole thing could have been squashed before the fishing took place. "All tuai-tuai rumah were called down and saw me in the Fort. Berai and Buli were very out¬ spoken and the case occupied most of one day; Berai and Buli were dealt with severely, and other tuai-tuai rumah were fined small amounts. "Afterwards, when the case was over, Berai and Buli became quite friendly, and assured me that such a thing would not happen again. After this affair I definitely think we shall either have to move Penghulu Begok to the Anap—I do not suppose be would go—or get another penghulu for that river.” Alterations to the Tatau Fort so as to accommo¬ date the wireless station in this building were completed during the month. Work on the new quarters for the wireless operator/clerk was com¬ menced. September 26th, the birthday of His Highness the Rajah, was observed as a public holiday al Bintulu. A local regatta was held on this day which, was a complete success. The entries for each race were surprisingly good,—in the 15 men temuai race there were 15 starters. There were a great number of Dayaks down for the races; these people celebrated in the usual way and a great day was enjoyed by all. The log boom belonging to the Sarawak Timber and Trading Company, Ltd., which broke towards the end of last month has successfully been repaired and most of the logs which got away have been collected at different points. Flying boat No. K.4581 passed over Bintulu on the morning of September 30th. Air Commodore Sydney Smith, who was on board, dropped a message of greeting as he passed over. This mess¬ age was recovered by a Dayak from the Sungei Jingin whch runs close by the Fort. His Highness the Rajah’s Birthday Celebrations in Miri. CEREMONIAI. PARADE AND PRESENTATION OF MEDALS. Having rained almost the entire day previously, the outlook for the programme which had been prepared for the celebration of His Highness' birthday in Miri looked bad. However, Saturday morning brought bright sunshine and a cool breeze and the first part of the programme, the ceremonial parade of the Constabulary, on the ‘‘padang’’ was attended by large numbers of Europeans, natives. Chinese and Indians. At eight o’clock precisely the Resident, accompanied by the District Officer, arrived at the saluting base, when the flag was broken and the anthem played. The Resident then inspected the troops under the command of Mr. R. G. Talbot drawn up in line, after which they inarched past in column of platoons and in close column . The troops then fired a feu de joie, gave three cheers His Highness and finally advanced in review order Hollow square was then formed and the Resi¬ dent presented the Long Service Decorations to five Government servants and the Constabulary Long Service medal to one man. An innovation this year was the presence of 500 picked school children, drawn from the Govern¬ ment Vernacular School, St. Columba's School, St. Joseph’s School, the Chung Hua School, the Hwa Chiao School and the Kung Ho School, Lutong, who were drawn up on each side of the grandstand facing the troops. After the presentation of medals and the troops had marched off. these children marched past by schools and made a brave display with bands and flags. A move was then made to the Gymkhana Club where the Resident proposed the health of His Highness the Rajah, which was drunk with acclamations by Europeans and natives. A word here should be said for the steadiness of the troops on parade. It is never easy to carry out ceremonial movements on grass, especially in this case after a day’s rain, but nothing marred the evolutions and the parade compared favourably with the former Sarawak Rangers. SPORTS. At 2 p.m. land sports were held at the padang. These sports, which used to be a great annual fixture, had been abandoned for some years in favour of Regattas. This year, is was decided to see whether the same interest remained. It is pleasant to note, therefore, that the popularity of this type of sport has not declined. Enormous entries were received and for the week previous heats were run off practically every afternoon. The greatest enthusiasm was shown and the hard work put in by the Committee and other workers was amply repaid by the success of the meeting. At the end of the sports the prizes were given away by Mrs. P. M. Scott, and this concluded a really excellent afternoon’s sport. Many persons helped, but perhaps special mention should be made of Messrs. D. C. White, A Goldie, W. Geikie and W. Carrol. We must not forget too. the band supplied by the Miri Engineering Association and the helpers who supplied all the school children with free refreshments during the afternoon. FUN FAYRE. A “Fun Fayre” was held at the Golf Club from 7 p.m. until the early hours of the next morning. A well-organised band of officials were most successful in extracting our money by the means of cocoanut shies, fortune tellers, dubious race games, electrical shocks, roulette. Aunt Sally and other such attractions. Attempts to achieve the impossible only resulted in more money going on what were, we fear, very one-sided games. However, the Golf Club made the money and we certainly enjoyed ourselves. There was a marvellous buffet where Mr. Johnston supplied enormous suppers for a dollar apiece. The usual glee party, led by Mr. C. W. Creek, ended the affair.—(Contributed.) CORRESPONDENCE. [The Editor is not responsible for the opinions of correspondents. ] Wireless Press News. The Editor, , Kuching. SIR, May we encroach on a modicum of your valu¬ able space to ventilate an appeal which, (if taken up by other influential publications in Singapore and elsewhere) may, eventually, reach the ears of those responsible for the dissemination of the very lengthy and too often tedious Wireless Press News? Dwellers in outstations especially are naturally most grateful for the service, improvements in which, however, would be welcome, without doubt, all the world over. Very few people, for instance want to hear long paraphrased speeches by the Foreign Ministers of obscure states, giving their unemployment figures, or the amount of cattle cake exported by them in the last twelve months. Nor is anyone, nowadays, interested in the policy and intentions of various screamingly excited middle European States, became policy and intentions are seldom carried out and are there¬ fore neither interesting nor informative. Items of real interest, such as the capture of important points in the Spanish rebellion, or the progress of some big air race, etc., are frequently omitted, glossed over in a line or two, or hidden in a mass of dull trade figures. The average journalist is a master of 'précis’ and has a news sense as sharp as any bloodhound's nose for meat, but it would be surprising to hear that there are any such journalists on the boards of the various wireless news agencies. Yours faithfully. TELLUS. MOORE & SHORTER, LTD. [The wireless press news that we receive in Sarawak is not sent out by a news agency at all, but by the British Government under the title ‘British Official Press.’ so our correspondent is probably correct in assuming that professional journalists have little enough to do with it. We should remember that if this Official Press News is perhaps less interesting than that provided by Reuter’s or the other News Agencies, it is supplied to us gratis, whereas Reuter’s service costs money. Incidentally, the word influential in our correspondent's first paragraph strikes a timely note.—ED.] “PANAU" Fishing. 19th October, 1936. The Editor, , Kuching SIR, With reference to the interesting account of panau fishing described in the August report of the District Officer, Kuching, published in your issue of October 1st. the following particulars may be of interest. This method of fishing is not unique; it was copied by the Bintulu fishermen from Trengganu Nakadas and others trading to and from Bintulu in by-gone years. (Quite a number of the descen¬ dants of these men now live in Bintulu. married to local women.) Panau has been practised in Bintulu for many years, very large catches resulting from it. The conical net is not really an idus, it is a large jala, and the divers (four, one at each comer) having cajoled and ‘edged’ the fish up into the cone, close the base. simultaneously tugging the line as a signal for the lifting of the net. The idus proper is an enormous slambau used by the Mukah fishermen. It is a triangular net (on the shrimp-catching principle) which is operated from the side of a barong which sails along crab-wise and beam on to shade fronds lowered some days before. The net is pushed along below the surface and when below the frond, it is lifted with fish, if any. The catches are much smaller than those obtained by the Bintulu method, no divers being used. A few years ago some Bintulu men came over to Mukah to try the local waters with the jala method. Although larger catches than those of the idus were made, they said the idus method, (involving no 'cajoling' by divers), must have scared the fish which were found to be much warier than the Bintulu ones, consequently the method was not a success locally and the idus is still the vogue. Yours faithfully, J. G. ANDERSON. [The writer of this very interesting letter is mistaken in one small particular, namely in stating that fishermen who employ the true idus do not use divers.—they do, and I have seen them at it. They also most definitely 'cajole' the fish into the net, this being an essential feature of panau fishing at Mukah and Oya. When the palm-frond that acts as ‘bait’ is approached, one of the fishermen secures the rattan line by which it is anchored to the bottom and draws the frond slowly towards the barong; if it is seen that fish have been attracted (they are easily visible in the clear water), the frond is released, the barong makes a circle.—being pro¬ pelled by oars, incidentally, not sails,— and as the frond is again approached, the idus is lowered. When it is in the 'ready' position, the rattan line is caught with a primitive boathook and the frond is drawn gently over the net, the fish following it like sheep. Two men now dive into the sea, one from each end of the barong, and turn back any stragglers, literally 'chivying' them into the net; when they have rounded up all fish in the vicinity and edged them over the idus, this is lifted, and the catch is tipped into the boat. The two divers come to the surface puffing and blowing, clamber on board again, and the barong moves off to the next palm-frond, where the process is repeated. It is an extremely interesting and attractive sight to see the divers at work in the clear blue water, since they are so skilful that they seem like a larger variety of fish themselves. It is a curious fact, incidentally, that although the barongs operate several miles from the shore and in comparatively deep water, no diver has been attacked by a shark in living memory. The fishermen attribute this immunity partly to the observance of certain pantang, which are of considerable interest, and which are well worth studying.—RD ] THE .

The sail news was conveyed to His Highness the Rajah by telegram early the following morning. All flags throughout the State were at once halfmasted. and in the afternoon the. Government offices in Kuching were closed as a mark of respect. The following telegram was despatched by His Hjghness the Rajah to His Excellency the British Agent for Sarawak:— "The news of His Majesty’s death has been received here with profound sorrow. On behalf of myself and my officers and all inhabitants of Sarawak I ask you to convey the expression of our deepest sympathy to Her Majestv the Queen and all members of the it Royal Family.- On January 22nd a telegram was received to say that His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales would be proclaimed King on that day, and the following proclamation was published by command of His Highness the Rajah in the form of a Government Gazette Extraordinary :— "Whereas it has pleased Almighty God to call from this mortal life our late Sovereign Lord King George the Fifth of happy memory : "Now, Therefore. We, Charles Vyner Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak. Knight Grand Cross of the Most. Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George, do hereby announce and proclaim that His Royal Highness Edward, Prince of Wales, is now become and has this day been proclaimed our rightful Sovereign Lord. Edward the Eighth by the Grace of God of Great Britain and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King. Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India. "Whom We and all Our subjects and all His Majesty's subjects in this Our Raj of Sarawak do acknowledge and acclaim. "Given at Kuching, this twenty-second day of January in the year of Our lord One thousand nine hundred and thirty-six.” GOD SAVE THE KING. His Highness also stated that it was his wish that all Europeans in Sarawak should wear appropriate mourning until after the funeral of His Late Majesty. On January 28th, the day on which the royal funeral took place, the Government offices in Kuching were closed, and a memorial service was held at St. Thomas’ Pro-Cathedral, the sermon being preached by the Venerable Archdeacon Hollis. A memorial service was also held at St. Joseph's Church, and in accordance with the suggestion of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, two minutes' silence was observed at 1.30 p.m, (local time), a gun being fired from Fort Margherita to mark the commencement and termination of the silence. Later in the day the following telegram was received from the Secretary of State for the Colonies :— "I am desired by Queen Mary to request you to convey to His Highness the Rajah of Sarawak the sincere thanks of Her Majesty and members of the Royal Family for the kind message of sympathy in their great kiss which was transmitted in your telegram of 21st January.” Flags were flown again at the mast-head on January 29th. The news of the death of His Majesty King George the Fifth was received in Sarawak with the most profound and heartfelt regret. Although the Wireless Press News, by transmitting the bulletins broadcast from Sandringham, had enabled us to follow the course of the King's had illness, the severity of this illness was not generally realized until the receipt of the message which announced that the life of His Majesty was drawing peacefully to its close. The shock of His Majesty's death, however, was in no way lessened by the fact that when the news came it was not entirely unexpected. It is now evident that His Majesty had been in failing health for some months past, but this was not known in Sarawak, and the news that the King was dying was received everywhere with the greatest concern and dismay. Even in the face of the wireless messages, it was difficult to believe the truth, since only a few days earlier His Majesty appeared to be in his customary health and spirits; the tragedy was heightened, too. by memories of the scenes that marked the Jubilee only a few short months ago. It seemed at first impossible to believe that the central figure of all that pageantry and splendour had passed from us for ever, and that the King, upon whom the loyally and devotion of a world-wide Empire had been focussed during those memorable days last May, had indeed been culled to his eternal rest. Although the inhabitants of Sarawak do not owe direct allegiance to the British Crown, it is safe to say that to all of them who maintain any contact with the outside world the King was more than the mere symbol of the protecting power. He was no distant and unreal figure, but a living personality whose influence could be felt even in the farthest coiners of the territories that acknowledged his sovereignty. With his passing we have lost a ruler and a leader, who, perhaps more than any of his predecessors, had the welfare of the Empire close to his heart, and to whose guidance the Empire owes an irreparable debt. We mourn a great sovereign.—one to whom duty was the breath of life, and one who has indeed deserved well of his subjects and the world. THE ROYAL FUNERAL. IMPRESSIVE CEREMONIAL. The following account of the lying-in-state and funeral of His Late Majesty King George V is taken from the British Official Wireless Press News. January 27th, 1936. The last day of the lying-in-state of the body of King George has seen an unbroken continuation of the vast concourse which has made the pilgrimage since Friday morning to pay homage before the Catafalque in Wesminster Hall. Driving rain during most of the day failed to disperse or apparenty to lessen the crowds which assembled in a queue many deep which at one time reached a length of three miles. In order not to disappoint mourners, who have come from all parts, the authorities have again arranged for the Hall to remain open into the early hours of the morning and the doors will not be shut officially till 4 p.m. only some seven hours before the coffin is due to start on the. last journey to Windsor. Manx foreign Royalties and Heads of State or their representatives and distinguished foreign statesmen arrived in England to-day to attend the funeral of King George to-morrow. The King of Denmark and the King of Belgians arrived this afternoon, and also the President of the French Republic. Monsieur Lebrun. Naval escorts were provided across the channel, and they were received at Dover with a royal salute of guns. The Crown Prince of Sweden and Crown Prince of Italy also reached London this afternoon, other distinguished arrivals including Prince George and Prince Nicholl of Greece. President Lebrun, who is staying at the French Embassy, is accompanied by the new French Foreign Minister, Monsieur Flandin. The royal visitors were met al Victoria Station by the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent. To-morrow the coffin of the late King will be removed from the Catafalque in Westminster Hall, where it has received the homage of hundreds of thousands of his subjects in the last four days, and borne in precession along four miles of London streets to Paddington, where it will be placed in the funeral coach for Windsor. Immediately behind the gun-carriage with the coffin will walk His Majesty King Edward, followed by the members of the British and foreign royal families on fool, and Her Majesty Queen Mary in a carriage. The gun-carriage will be preceded by a military and naval procession a mile long. Troops in the procession will be dismounted, and will march in slow time with arms reversed. Minute guns will lie fired in Hyde Park and at the Tower of London from the time the procession leaves Westminster Hall till it has reached Paddington about two hours later. At Windsor, where the late King will be buried with honours of an Admiral of the Fleet, as soon as the gun-carriage to which the coffin will be transferred at Windsor Station reaches St. George's Chapel the dead King will he "piped along." and as the hearer company of Grenadier Guards carries the coffin into the Chapel, he will be "piped aboard.” The close of the service will coincide with the two minutes’ silence which will be observed throughout the country. Some fifteen hundred wreaths from mourners in every port of the world and of every degree, from kings to the poorest of the late King's subjects, had reached Windsor Castle this morning and all day hundreds more have been arriving. They have come from foreign royalties including the Emperor of Japan, the King of Italy, the Emperor of Ethiopia and the ex-Kaiser, from foreign and Empire Governments, from Municipalities, institutions and organizations of every kind, as well as from in dividuals. They include most magnificent and complicated examples of floral art and a few simple snowdrops sent by an East End London child. Queen Mary went to Westminster Hull again this evening ami stood before the coffin of the late King for some minutes. The Queen Mother Was accompanied by the members of her family as well as foreign royalties who are staying al Buckingham Palace. While the royal party remained, the procession of the public was interrupted. During the dav other foreign royalties and representatives of foreign countries arriving in London for the funeral visited Westminster Hall to pay homage at the Catafalque. Most elaborate preparations have been made to deal with the vast crowds which will mass themselves along the route of the royal funeral procession to-morrow. All parts of the route will be closed to vehicular traffic from 8 a.m., and the police have arranged for carefully planned traffic diversions. January 28th. A vast multitude, paid its final homage to King George the Fifth, when Ins mortal remains were borne in funeral procession through the streets of London and were buried this afternoon in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, in the presence of a congregation including world-wide representatives of lands where his memory is honoured. The coffin, draped in the Royal Standard, and surmounted by the Imperial Crown, the Orb and Sceptre, and the Insignia of the Order of the Garter, rested on a gun-carriage drawn by a naval gun's crew. Upon it rested a single floral emblem placed there by the mourning Queen. As the mile-long procession began its slow march from Westminster Hall the first of the seventy minute gnus was fired in Hyde Park. At its head walked the First and Second Divisions of the escort of Royal Horse Guards supported by the hands of the Third Carabiniers and of thee Household Cavalry, and by detachments of troops from the Dominions and Colonies, and from twenty-eight regiments of Regulars and Territorials of which the King was Honorary Colonel, representing all branches of the British Army. This section of the procession was dosed by representative detachments of the Royal Marines and the Royal Navy. Officers of foreign navies, armies and air forces including naval, military and air attaches followed. Next came Chaplains of forces, followed by high officers of the Royal Air Force, and after them General Officers Commanding- in-('hief, Field Marshals, officers of headquarters stuff, and members of the Army Council Representatives of the Merchant Navy and the Royal Naval Reserve preceded Admirals of Fleet. Admirals, and Vice-Admirals, and following them were aides-de-camp to King George from these service- Earl Marshal the Duke of Norfolk headed the central section of the procession, which included great Officers of State, and Officers of the King's household. Close to the gun-carriage were six of King George's equerries. Behind the King's coffin the Royal Standard was borne, and after the Standard walked King Edward. Queen Mary, accompanied by the Queen of Norway, the Princess Royal, and the Duchess of York. travelled in a glass coach and followed the visiting Kings and Heads of foreign States. Behind, on foot, were Ambassadors. Ministers, and High Commissioners, Seven other coaches carried other royal Indies, including Queen Victoria of Spain, the Duchess of Gloucester, and the Duchess of Kent. Suites of foreign royalties and members of foreign Governments were on foot behind them, followed the Third Division of the escort of Royal Horse Guards. The Fourth Division, preceded by detachments of police and the London fire brigade, closed the procession. Another great gathering of the nation's mourners awaiting the arrival of the funeral train at Windsor. and unseen multitudes throughout the British Empire and in many foreign countries, were able, IN MEMORIAM. His Majesty King George V. Born June 3rd. 1865. Died January 20th. 1936. He was the King: but not by law alone Held he the sceptre, played his kingly part: He, to whom duty was his very throne, Reigned in his people’s heart. T.S.B. through a broadcast account of it, to follow the procession on its way from Windsor Station through the Castle grounds to St.George's Chapel. The air in its vicinity was drenched in the perfume of flowers which had been sent from sorrowing subjects and foreign rulers and peoples, and which were laid all round the inner and outer walls of the cloisters. When the cortège arrived at the west door, listeners heard the shrill notes of the bosun's pipes, which, in accordance with naval ceremonial appropriate to the funeral of an admiral, had piped the coffin aboard the gun-carriage at the station, and now piped it in alongside the Chapel entrance. A lament by pipers followed as the body of the late King, headed by Kings-at-Arms with pursuivants and heralds in their picturesque uniforms in attendance was received by the clergy. headed by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York. Immediately behind was King Edward with Queen Man and other members of the royal family. Princess Elizabeth joined the procession inside the Chapel, where she had been awaiting its arrival. The service in the Chapel was broadcast, and reports already received indicate that it was clearly beard in distant parts of the Empire, in many of which it was re-broadcast. As the committal words were spoken by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the coffin sank below the Chapel floor, the sound could be heard of the earth brought from the royal burial ground at Frogmore being sprinkled upon it by King Edward. Not until after four o'clock this morning did the procession of those who for four days came from all over the country to pay tributes of sorrow before the coffin of their dead King cease its steady, silent, and reverend progress through Westminster Hall past the Catafalque with its motionless and bowed sentinels. The depth to which the feelings of the public have been moved by the passing of King George was demonstrated in this pilgrimage of crowds, which behaved throughout with orderliness and decorum, and endured long hours of wailing. The official estimate of numbers of those who saw the lying-in-state is over 809,000. In the press of crowds along the funeral route many persons fainted, and several were injured. Five thousand doctors, first-aid men and nurses were posted along the route, and there were fortythree casualty stations at specially selected points. Altogether over seven thousand people were treated. About 150 were taken to hospital by ambulance. The two minutes' silence, in which millions of his subjects who could not participate in to-day's ceremonies in London and at Windsor were able to pay their last tribute to the Monarch whom they respected and loved, was observed throughout the United Kingdom at 1.30 p.m. It had been intended that the silence should coincide with the end of the funeral service at St. George’s Chapel, but the slow progress of the funeral procession to Paddington Station took longer Ilian had been expected, and the funeral train moved off over half-an-hour late It happened that while the Empire observed the silence the coffin was still on its way from Windsor Station to the Castle. The King and Queen Mollier and other members of the royal family, together with foreign royalties and distinguished visitors, returned to London after the funeral service at Windsor. The King and Queen Marv then drove to Buckingham Palace. A BELOVED MONARCH. A great man and a great monarch has passed. Not the British Empire alone, but the whole world mourns, for no individual of the age won such universal affection and admiration as His Most Excellent Majesty George the Fifth, by the Grace of God of Great Britain, Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India—and ever the devoted servant of his people. Through years of upheaval, when monarchies tottered and fell, when the few surviving occupants of thrones became for the most part powerless figureheads. King George remained every inch a king. He consecrated his whole life to maintaining the dignity of the British Crown and wining the loyalty of his people. The measure of his success in gaining the affection of his subjects was apparent on the occasion of the Jubilee and again in tie intensity of the anxiety with which the course of his last illness was followed. He was something more than a ruler, something very much more. Tie was the head of a great family—kindly, thoughtful. ever mindful of the welfare of the humblest member of that family. He gave himself, utterly and unceasingly, to the Empire of which he was the living and ever-active head. By devotion he inspired devotion and the love of his people, given in such full measure, was the only reward that he sought. The simplicity of Ins messages io his subjects at Christmas, during the Jubilee celebrations and on other occasions depicts the man more faithfully than any words that will be written about him. To those who were present at the Thanksgiving Service in St. Paul's Cathedral in May last the pomp and ceremony of a State occasion left only a secondary impression. With the passing of years the spectacle, magnificent though it was. will become a dim memory. Hut the obvious delight of His Majesty the King at the demonstrations of affection, his very human reactions to the overwhelming evidence of deep love for t he monarch as well as for the. monarchy, are unforgettable. All the brilliance and all the grandeur were overshadowed by an air of intimacy which could have had no basis but genuine affection on both sides. We have. then, superabundant evidence of the low of the people for their king. What of King George's achievements as a ruler? We do not need to wait upon history for the answer. Fourteen British kings and queens and 44 English kings and queens preceded him. Many were great, but none was greater than he. Pause before condemning that statement as extravagant. Contemplate the shattering events of the past quarter of a century; see how little of the old order has survived. Yet through all the upheavals the British throne has remained firm and the solidarity of the Empire remains unimpaired. For that the credit does not go to any particular government. It cannot lie attributed alone to "the innate common sense of the British people." That, common sense needed guiding: the sacrifices that have been made so freely needed the encouragement of example. Guidance and example came in the fullest posssible measure from the throne. King George never became theatrical, he never attitudinised. On the either hand, he never allowed himself to become a puppet. As the head of a democratic State he ruled to the full extent, and no more, of the powers that were his under the Constitution. In many respects the executive responsibility of a British king is slight. It is iu guidance and example that the real power lies. In his relations with his Ministers, and in the example which he set by his high sense of duty and his unremitting labours for the good of the Empire. King George ruled more completely than does many a dictator. Mercifully death did not come until the success of his labours was established beyond doubt. He was spared to triumph. In the darkest days of the War, and again in the crisis of 1925 and 1931. the person of the King was the rallying point of the nation's tenacity. His courage was the people's inspiration. He led us through the shadows back to the brightness of hope. And there he leaves us, a noble task nobly done. We of all the nations can face the future with the greatest measure of confidence because we have been blessed with a ruler of great courage, great ability, great devotion to his heritage and a wholly exceptional capacity for winning loyalty and devotion- truly a king among kings.—Straits Times Jan. 21. Local and Personal. JANUARY. Her Highness the Ranee left Kuching by the Vyner Brooke on January 4th. With Her Highness were Dr. W. Hutchison, who accompanied Her Highness on the flight home, and Dayang Valerie, who saw the Ranee off and then stayed on in Singapore for some days, first as the guest of His Excellency the British Agent and Lady Thomas. and later as the guest of Air Commodore and Mrs. S. W. Smith. Her Highness the Ranee and Dr. W. Hut chison left Seletar by an Imperial Airways plane on January 9th, and reached England safely on the 17th. Dayang Valerie returned to Kuching on January 20 th. The Silver Wedding of Their Highnesses the Rajah and Ranee, which falls on February 24th. was observed on January 3rd owing to Her Highness the Ranee's impend ing departure for Europe. Their Highnesses gave a dinner party at Astana to about thirty guests. His Highness the Rajah paid two visits to Sibu Laut during the month, taking a small party with him on each occasion. The return journey after His Highness’ second visit was accomplished in almost exactly three hours, which must be very nearly a record time for the trip; this was due to the fact that Loba Kara has now been cleared and can take launches of the size of m.l. Betty, thereby eliminating the Santubong section of the former route. We hear, incidentally, that a road linking up the present. Lundu road with Tanjong Umbang may shortly be constructed. Tanjong Umbang is only about one hour by launch from Sibu Laut, so the projected road should bring this delightful seaside resort within easy reach of Kuching. An R.A.F. flying-boat from the Air base at Seletar arrived at Pending on January 20th. She proceeded on the 22nd to Sibu and Bintulu, and returned to Singapore on the 25th. The machine was piloted by Squadron Leader Lloyd and Flying Officer Michell, and carried as passengers Wing Commander C. W. George, Wing Commander the Rev. J. A. Jagoe, and Mr. Franks. No. 205 (flying-boat) squadron, which was due to call at Kuching on February 14th during the course of an official flight to China and Japan, is now expected to arrive at Pending on February 10th. The squadron will leave for Kudat on the following day. A party of officers and men from H.M.S. Lowestoft, which was at Rejang from December 29th until January 4th, saw the New Year in at Sibu. We understand that the Island Club lived up to its reputation on this occasion, and that the visitors departed with a good impression of Sibu hospitality. Mr. T. J. H. Speedy, Surveyor General of British North Borneo, broke his journey Northward on his return from furlough in order to spend a few days in Kuching, where he was the guest of Mr. W. Harnack. We deeply regret to record the death, which occurred at the General Hospital, Singapore, on January 15th. of Dr. G. E. Brooke. Dr. Brooke, who was for many years Chief Health Officer Singapore, came to Sarawak to reorganize the Health Department in 1928 and retired in 1931. During his stay in Kuching he was responsible for the lay-out of the public gardens in the Museum grounds, a task in which he was eminently successful; the gardens are now one of the chief amenities of the town, and will remain a fitting memorial to him. Mr. J. B. Archer, Resident, Fourth Division, paid a visit to Kuching during January, arriving on January 18th and leaving on the A very successful Regatta was held at Kuching on New Year’s Day under the auspices of the Secretary for Native Affairs, the Datus and some of the leading Malays and Chinese. The full programme and results will be found under First Division News. Mr. and Mrs. A. L. McLaine returned from Singapore by s.s. Darvel on January 6th, and left for Sibu the same afternoon. Mr. and Mrs. L. D. Kennedy returned by the Vyner Brooke on January 20th. Kudang. a Dayak outlaw and murderer, was killed by levies on January 8th. His head was brought to Song Fort, and the Government reward of $500 has been paid to those responsible. Two other "wanted” Dayaks. Makau and Serai, were captured a few days later by police detachments under Mr. A. Macpherson and Native Officer Wan Bujang. Both men are believed to have been concerned in the Pelagus affair which took place in August. 1934. and in which a Malay and a Kayan were killed by a Dayak raiding party. Makau and Serai are at present awaiting trial Mr. K. H. Digby. Passed Cadet, has been transferred to Bau. where he is attached to the District Office for special duty in connection with mining. Mr. Digby recently completed a census of the Simanggang Road area. The results of this census were rather remarkable, since it was found that nearly 3,000 people are living in the one-mile reserves between the 10th mile and Serian. and that, in this same reserve there arc some , 7,300 acres of land not merely alienated, but actually under cultivation. It should be borne in mind, also, that the reserve is by no means the whole area served by the road. These figures are significant when it is realized that the road, which has always been far from perfect, has only been open during the worst years of the depression, and that ever since it has been open immigration has been rigorously restricted. Visitors to Kuching during January included Messrs. G. A. Farrelly and R. E. Le Sueur from Sibu, and Mr. G. Kidd. Manager of Tanah Estates. Ltd., from Kanowit. Mr. C. D. Le Gres Clark returned from : furlough by the Vyner Brooke on January 20th. Mr. Le Gros Clark has been appointed Secretary for Internal Affairs, and has been promoted to Class IB of the Civil Service. Mr. J. R. Outram, Passed Cadet, has been transferred from Bau to Limbang. Dr. Brooke. So Dr. Gilbert Brooke has pissed on—a true Malayan, if ever there was one, a lover of this country in its many aspects and one of the few Europeans who have sunk roots deep enough to enable them to retire here. In Dr. Brooke’s case, there was also the presence of various members of his family to keep him in Malaya, but that was by no means the whole story. He had too many local interests to enable him to settle down happily anywhere else. I have never known anyone who was so calm, so gentle one might almost say, and yet so efficient. His office in Singapore, when he was reorganising quarantine, work in the port and extending antimalarial protection on the island and doing half a dozen other things besides, always seemed to be running like a well-oiled machine. Dr. Brooke and Dr. Scharff made an admirable team in those days. Even one who, like myself, had met Dr. Brooke only casually and occasionally must feel sorrow at his passing. One always felt that in him there was a living example of how to live in Malaya, how to put back into the. country something in return for what one got out of it. And he had the rare and enviable gift of getting the best out of an Asiatic staff by inspiral ion rather than coercion.—“ANAK SINGAPURA' in the Straits Times. Racecourse Development Fund.

With thee Government Government opening on January 1st of the new offices at Serian, one of the oldest stations in the country ceases to be a district headquarters. Ever since the first Rajah took over the Sadong river Simunjan has been the headquarters of the Sadong district, and has indeed been closely identified with the district itself owing to being generally known (though quite wrongly) as "Sadong." The natives invariably refer to the station now known as "Sadong" by its old and correct name Simunjan; the actual Sadong river is an insignificant little stream far up-country which flows into the left-hand branch of the main river near the Dutch border. In this connection, it is interesting tn see in an old map of Sarawak that both Sadong and Simunjan are marked approximately in their correct positions,—the former far in the ulu near Tebekang, and the latter at the mouth of the Simunjan river. In view of this, it is difficult to see how the mistake regarding the name arose. The early history of Simunjan was sufficiently lurid. Tn September, 1839, James Brooke called at the mouth of what is now known as the Sadong river on his way back to Singapore after his first visit to Sarawak Proper, and made the acquaintance there of the famous Sherip Sahap, a half-bred. Arab who ruled—or rather, misruled—the district. He returned again in December, 1840, and went up to the Simunjan lakes on an expedition in search of orang-utan. He described Simunjan as “a pretty little village where the Datu furnished us with a capital house''; on the first night of his visit the Rajah's boats were swamped by the bore, but after righting them he proceeded to the ulu and obtained a small orang-utan. Here also he met the Sebuyau and Balau Dayaks, who lived near the lakes. The inhabitants of Simunjan, though they lived under the rule of Sherip Sahap, a notorious pirate, were not themselves pirates, and the Sherip had to rely on the Skrang and Saribas Sea Dayaks, over whom he had a great influence, to commit his raids for him. As a result, the Sadong Malays and Dayaks were continually being attacked by Sherip Sahap’s hordes from the Saribas, and this caused many families to seek comparative safety in Sarawak Proper. In 1844, however, the Arab chieftain, having had due warning of what was coming to him, left Sadong and went to live in the Skrang, where later he was attacked and compelled to flee ignominiously into Dutch territory. Here he died soon afterwards,—of a broken heart, it is said, though whether such a blood-thirsty ruffian had a heart to break is doubtful. In 1849 a large force of Saribas pirates attacked Simunjan and killed over a hundred people. They were checked on their progress up-river at Gedong. which is some six hours' paddling above Simunjan; by means of a ruse, however, Gedong was captured, and the whole population slaughtered. Outrages of this sort were common under the appalling misrule of the Brunei pengirans, and wars and rumours of war were part of the ordinary life of the district. In 1853, however, all this was changed. Until this year Sadong had normally been under the control of Brunei and outside the sphere of James Brooke's administration, but the district was now ceded to the Rajah together with the Batang Lupar and Kalnka rivers, and the inhabitants began at last to enjoy the blessings of peace. But all the same, the bad old days were not quite over, since in 1860, when the plot to exterminate all Europeans in Sarawak and Dutch West Borneo was being hatched. Sherip Masahor used the Sadong district as his centre of operations. Charles Brooke, who at the time was Tuan Muda, got news of this, and immediately went to Sitnunjan. On his way there he met the famous Sherip and forbade him to enter the Sadong river, but when he reached Simnnjan he learned that his orders had been disobeyed. He left at once in bis gunboat the Jolly Bachelor and attacked the Sherip and his war boats at Sebangan. completely routing them. Thc Sherip himself escaped in a small boat to Mukah. his life having been spared by the Tuan Muda, it is alleged, because his person was too sacred in the eyes of Muslims to be harmed. The Tuan Muda returned to Simunjan in triumph to find that during his absence the Bandar Kassim laid incited the Malays to attack the fort. This, however, they had refused to do, and when the Tuan Muda reached the Malay town of Gedong, the Malays all acknowledged him as their ruler. The Bandar Kassin was forced to flee the country, and all his goods were confiscated. Shortly after this last and final engagement, the inhabitants of Simunjan put behind them all thoughts of intrigue against the Rajah’s Government, and turned to the more peaceful occupation of coal-mining, and it is on account of its coal mine that Simunjan is chiefly known in Sarawak history. The mine was closed down in 1931. hut for over half a century it had provided employment for the people of Sadong and coal for the Government. The colliery was situated some three miles from Simunjan and comprised most of the western slope of Gunong Ngili. a bill some 900 feet high To those who are acquainted with the neighbourhood, it may be of interest to learn that forty years ago vessels between 400 and GOO tons used to steam up the Sungei Simnnjan Dania mid berth alongside the colliery wharf. Nowadays Chinese motorschooners of only 20 tons rest mournfully on the mud awaiting cargoes a few yards from the former kuala, and at low tide the river is completely dry. This change began during the first decade of the present century and was largely brought about by an over-enthusiastic District Officer cutting through a tanjong between the Sungei Simunjan and the Batang Sadong. mainly with the object, it is believed, of shortening the journey to the snipegrounds. As a result, the present kuala is now more than half a mile up-river. The last train from the colliery to Simunjan ran over the track on April 20th, 1935, and brought remnants of scrap-iron from the mine for shipment to Singapore. Since the colliery was closed down Simunjan has naturally declined in importance, and now hands over the cares of the district to her offspring Serian whose importance has steadily increased with the construction of the Kuching- Simanggang road. Simunjan, though, has had an interesting life. After a turbulent and exciting youth, the station settled down as the headquarters of a quiet and contented district; with the opening of the colliery, lists showing exports of coal figured regularly in the monthly reports instead of tales of head-hunting, punitive expeditions and peace-makings. and the whole district enjoyed the advantages of peace and a settled Government.— E.H.E. Safety of Air Transport. PUBLIC OPINION THE ARBITER. Recent happenings in the air transport field have forced into bloom many vari-coloured opinions. That there have been accidents to aircraft no one will deny, and equally undeniable is the action of the antagonists in seizing on these incidents (for they are nothing more) to forecast dire things for air transport. Conversely the protagonists, spurred by blind enthusiasm, are wreaking equal mischief by overstating the case for aviation, by advancing extravagant claims that collapse under the weight of cold facts. Between these extremities lies the truth. From thc dawn of transport whqn Man, more richly endowed than his fellow creatures in his ability tn think and reason, enlisted invention to case the burden of carriage, every forward move in the restless march has resulted from the unreasoning, reckless faith of a pioneer. The Neolithic man who laboriously fashioned the first sledge; the ancient Egyptian who employed rollers to move the collosal statues of his gods; the early Roman who extended the use of rollers and produced the first wheeled vehicle: the Montgolfier brothers, inventors of the balloon; George Stephenson, father of the modern railway ; Otto and De Dion who gave us the motor car: the Wright brothers, first in the field of mechanical flight. All these were pioneers, all were laughed at, scorned, ridiculed. Only their faith enabled them to carry their experiments to a successful conclusion, to forge yet another link in the transport chain. But it was not their faith that proved the strength and safety of the link. That was left for the public, for the masses who paused to jeer, stopped to wonder, and at length remained to try and to test. Public opinion always lias been and always will be the arbiter of a transport system Public patronage is the life blood of any community service whether it be by sea or land or air. and any transport system that fails to demonstrate its utility and safety to the complete satisfaction of the public must perish from lack of nourishment. Sixteen years ago commercial air transport was born. In 1920 commercial aeroplanes flew a distance of 1,022,000 miles. Airliners engaged on regular services throughout the world in 1934 covered a distance of 103,432,000 miles. Those figures represent the measure of public approval and confidence. Continual improvement in both machine and engine design, more ingenious aids to air navigation, closer attention to service and maintenance and to the technique of piloting have all played their part in providing greater dependability. It is to these factors than an official of Qantas Empire Airways referred in citing the splendid record attained during 12 months operation of the 4,361-mile Brisbane-Singapore air service, and in compiling the noteworthy aggregate of 480,000 miles of flight without a single forced landing. This Australian service is being maintained with D.H.86 four-engined aircraft, and Qantas place complete confidence in this type after exhaustive tests under actual working conditions. No transport organization, whether it operates on land, on sea, or in the air. has ever been able entirely to eliminate accidents. Sceptics and enthusiasts alike would do well to remember that life is beset hv dangers and that the perils of man’s span range from whooping cough in infancy to falling down stairs in old ape.—Commercial Aviation News.) Two kinds of Nuisances. The articles entitled "Is Gendang Tanda An Entertainment?," published in the December, 1935, and January, 1936. issues, are very interesting. But it is a subject on which opinions differ rather too greatly, which makes it unpleasant to discuss. One section of the community may consider that gendang tanda is a form of entertainment from which a great deal of enjoyment can be derived, while another may deem it a nuisance on account of the monotonous din it creates, and of its unrestricted nature. Because I have not go far really enjoyed a gendang party—and I have attended quite a few —nor have I been really disturbed by one during the night, I am not going to commit myself by giving an opinion. It will be sufficient to say that it is largely a question of taste, although 1 agree that a time limit would improve matters. However, this is really not the subject about which I wish to write. 1 think many readers living in Kuching will agree with me that we are being pestered by a rial nuisance the beggars. There are some who think that by giving alms to these beggars they will be doing good in this world, so that when the day of reckoning comes round, they will have something to their credit to show. This is all very good and noble, but one should also bear in mind that there are beggars and beggars. For instance, would anyone conscientiously describe a man a beggar who is physically well-built, hefty, and able to do a job of work? No, certainly not. Yet many of the socalled ’beggars' are persons of this class, and they thrive on just because they find it so easy to earn' a living by the simple process of bandaging parts of their legs with dirty rags, by putting a coating of dust on their faces, by limping a little in spite of the stout sticks they carry, and by begging from house to house; and just because some people arc so easily deceived by their outward appearance. I have no doubt that the people who give them aims really mean to be kind, but misplaced kindness of this nature is likely to do more harm than good. It encourages the 'beggars.' In other words, it makes more 'beggars.' A friend of mine recently told me that one of these 'beggars' went to sen mine acquaintances who were employed in his garden. In the course of their conversation, the 'beggar’ was heard to remark that they were all ven foolish to work so hard for a living, whereas he had only to disguise himself a little and beg. Of course my friend helped him along by giving him the order of the boot. Such 'beggars' are invariably driven away by me, too, and if more people were to take the same action under these circumstances, our lives would be more worth living, since we would no longer be continuously harassed by the cries of "Towkay, tolonq ; towkay, tolonq." There is, however, another kind of beggars, for whom we cannot help having some genuine compassion. These are the old and/or decrepit men, who have no one upon whom they can rely for support, and who have not the necessary strength to work. Such poor fellow-creatures. unlike those described in my preceding paragraph who cannot even assume a correct pleading tone, are really to he pitied; if anyone can see his way to do a little charitable work here, I am sure that his energy and goodwill will not ho wasted.—C.S.S. Conservancy of Inland Fisheries. PROHIBITION OF TUBA FISHING. On July 1st, 1936, tuba fishing will become a thing of the past in Sarawak, for on that date an order will come into operation which states that "No person shall put in any running stream, navigable river or estuary any tuba root, explosive or any substance which has the affect of stupefying, stunning or poisoning fish.” That such an order was badly needed is proved by the fact that the ulus of many rivers have been almost entirely denuded of fish as the result of ruinous use of tuba on the part of Dayaks and other natives. The natives themselves are by no means blind to the stupidity of this policy of wholesale and wanton destruction, but as things stand at present they are unable to stop it. It is the usual case of "devil take the hindermost;" the inhabitants of each village use the argument that if they do not tuba all the neighbouring streams, somebody else will, and so the merry game goes on. Groups of two or three long-houses combine to tuba certain reaches of rivers at frequent intervals, and often enough they have to hurry to avoid clashing with rival groups. The disastrous results of this senseless competition are only too apparent, and in many cases the natives have stated that they would definitely favour any action which would put an end to the evils of the present system. Owing to the impossibility of their reaching any agreement among themselves, however, there was no hope of them exercising any control on their own initiative, so Government intervention became inevitable. Various ways and means of instituting some sort of effective control were discussed, but after full consideration it was decided that nothing but complete prohibition would meet the case. Six months will elapse, however, before this prohibition comes into force, and during this period Administrative Officers have been asked to give the widest possible publicity to the matter, and to take steps to ensure that the people concerned understand the objects of prohibition Although there will naturally bo some complaints at first , al any rate from Dayaks, it is probable that the grumblers will soon be silenced by results. A year or two ago tuba fishing was prohibited throughout the ulu Ai by a local order. This measure was hailed with a sigh of relief by many of the Dayaks themselves, and the experiment proved completely successful, since the stocking of the rivers responded al once, and after few months fish became plentiful; instead of obtaining meagre catclaw every few weeks, the Dayaks only had to go out with a jala for half-of-an-hour or so to catch enough fish to feed their families. It will bo interesting to see whether the general prohibition of tuba fishing will produce the same results elsewhere in the country, though there is little doubt that this will be the case. It is hoped, also, that once the natives realise the eventual benefits that will result from prohibition, they will give it their support and co-operation as they did in the ulu Ai. Certainly they should in time be grateful for a measure designed to assist the conservation and rational exploitation of a potentially valuable food supply. حال ممليهراكناايكن٢ دارت تݢهن منوبا ايك. فد سهاريبولن جولي 1936 توبا منوبا ايكن اكن منجادي ساتو تݢهن ددالم نݢري مسراواق كران کتيک ايت اكن دتربيت ساتوءاونداڠ٢ يڠ مڽاتكن دماکين "تياد سياف٢ فون دبنرکن مناره کدالم سبارڠ سوڠي بسر اتو كچيل اتو دمورا سوڠي ياءيت اكر توبا, لتوفن, اتو سبارڠ جوا بندا يڠ ممباوا كبودوهن, مڠجوتکن، اتو مراچونکن ايکن " اداله کواجيفنڽ منربيتکن اوندڠ٢ سفرت اين اوله سبب كڽتاءن يڠ سبنرڽ ياءيت كباڽقکن داولو سوڠي٢ تله سام سلكالي ليچبي تياد برايكن درسبب تركناً راچون توبا اوله اورڠ٢ داياء دان انق٢ نݢري. بومي فترا تىتوله مليهتكن كاءداءن يڠامة كبودوهن داءتس فربواتن يڠ ممبوروڠكن دان سڠاج مروسقكن كهيدوفن ديري سنديري دالم ايتفون هڠݢ سكارڠ ماسيه جوا تياد ماهو دبرهنتيث دمکينله حالڽ تياد امببيل سديكيت هيرو فون- اورڠ٢ دساتو٢ كمفوڠ برتڠکر٢ ياءيت جكلو مريكنيت تياد فرݢى منوبا دسكلين سوڠي٢ يڠبردكتن ملينكن لاءين اورڠ كلق منوبا جادي ايت بايكله برامي٢ مريک فرݢي. ݢومفولن درفد دوا اتو تيݢ رومه فنجڠ تورت منوبا دسوات سوڠي برهمفيران فد تيف٢ كالي دان جكلو دافت سبوله٢ث بربوة٢ سفاي تياد منجادي ݢادوه دڠن سݢومغولن يڠلاين فول. حال كجادين يڠتياد سنونوه اين سفرة برلومبا٢ دڠن تيدق منارهكن فيكيران ايله نمفق تروس ترڠڽ دان كباڽقكن انق٢ نݢري ايت مڠاكون ياءيت مريكئيت سوک مڠيكوة اف٢ جوا حكومن يڠ عاديل بوله ممادامكن حال يڠ كاروت يڠاد برلاكو فد ماس اين. اوله سبب مريكئيت تياد برستوجو دان برموافقت سام سنديري دان تياد ماهو كاله ساتو سام لاين مك ترففساله اتس فرنته مڠاتورکن حال اين. دڠن براف جالن دان اختيار مڠاداكن سرب سربي باݢي مناهنكن حال اين اکن تتافي فد اخير فيكيران يڠدفوتوسکن هڽا دڠن تݢهن تياًد بوله منوبا سام سكالي. سمنتارا بلوم هابيس انم بولن مك تݢهن اين ددالم ماس سكارڠ فݢاوي٢ فرنته يڠ منجوانكن ججاهن تلوق رنتوفاسيسير تله دسورهکن ممبريتاهو كفد سكلين اورڠ٢ ايسي نݢري دان مڠمبيل لڠكهن باݢي مننجوقكن کفد مريک هڠݢ مڠرتي مقصود توجوان تݢهن يڠترسبوه ايت. سوڠݢهفون فد فرمولاءنڽ بارڠكالي اد اورڠ٢ داياء مڠادو حالث تتافي تياد شق ياءيت مريک تنتو سنڠ هاتي اوله كاءوتتوڠن تربيت درفد تݢهن ايت. سمنجق ستاهن دوا دهولو مك حال منوبا ايكن تله دلارڠكن دسلوره اولو اءي اوله ساتو اودر(اوندڠ٢) خاص باݢيڽ مك اختيار اين تله ممبري ببراف فاءيده دان فرتولوڠن كفد اورڠ٢ داياء سنديري دان فرچوباءن ايت دافتله مڠهافوسكن كجياءن كران دري ايت ددالم سوڠي٢ تله دڠن لكس دفنوهي اوله ايکن٢ دالم ماس بربولن سهاج ددالم حال يڠدمكين اورڠ٢ داياء بوله منجالا ايكن دڠن ستڠه اتو لبه سجم اكن مندافت چوكف ايكن فاكي فرماكنن انق بينيڽ دري منوبا ايكن فد تيف٢ ميڠݢو دڠن سديكيت كاءؤليهن مك دڠن ساڠة ݢمر دان اينده دهاتي كيت مليهتکن كاءداءن تݢهن يڠدمكين. دهارف دلاين٢ تمفت مڠيكوة بݢيتو جوا. افبيل انق٢ نݢري مندافة كاءونتوڠن كران تݢهن ايت ملينكن مريک منولوڠ دان ممبنتو سفرة يڠدفربوانكن داولو اير تيدق بوله تيدق مريك ننتي منجادي سنڠ جكلو فراتوران يڠ ممليهرا دان مناهن اورڠ منوبا ايكن يڠ منجادي ساتو فرماكنن يڠ ككل اداڽ.Films of the Month. When Reuben Mamoulian puts his "chop" on a film, one can usually be sure that it will be worth watching. This was certainly the case with We Live Again, a screen version of Tolstoy's celebrated novel ''Resurrection." This was an outstanding film, and one which justifies the use of almost every superlative in a critic's vocabulary. The photography, the acting, the settings and the production were as nearly perfect as they could well be; and the atmosphere of pre-revolutionary Russia was captured with complete success. The story, though it possesses the grandeur of everything that came from Tolstoy's pen, is just a little too nineteenthcentury fur modern tastes, but it is undoubtedly impressive, and Mamoulian has an unerring flair for avoiding the pitfalls of false sentiment into which most other producers would have plunged headlong. For once, too, we were spared the conventional happy ending which would have spelt the artistic ruin of a fine film. Tolstoy's story, which was closely followed (again a refreshing change from most screen adaptations of novels', is too well-known to need recapitulation. Anna Sten gave a magnificent performance as Katusha Maslova, the peasant girl who is ruined by Prince Dmitri (Fredric March), and Aubrey Smith was perfect in the part of a Moscow High Court Judge. The acting throughout, indeed, was of an exceptionally high quality, and the players were all intelligently cast. Many of the scenes will live long in the memory, particularly the Easter live service, and the shots of peasants at work in the fields. The Court and prison scenes were also effective, and make one wonder why the revolution did not come many years before it did. A superb film, and one to see again. We Live Again was preceded by The. Grasshopper and the Ants, the best Silly Symphony that has yet me to Kuching. The grasshopper was one of the most delightful of all the fantastic creations of Walt Disney’s imagination, and the colouring, dialogue, and music were all equally striking. Disney is a genius of no mean order, and this symphony showed him at bis best. In Clive of India, Ronald Colman showed once again what a splendid actor he is when he is given a part that soils him. If he failed slightly to portray the dour, tormented creature that was the real Clive, this was the fault of the play, which gave as a highly idealised version of the chain of events that added India to the Empire. The film, however, was an undoubted success. Loretta Young did very well as Margaret Maskelync. Clive's devoted wife, and Francis Dister was adequate as her brother. January was remarkable for two first-class British farces. The first. You Made Ue Love You. showed Stanley Lupino in a splendid piece of fooling, and one after his own heart. Two of the scenes, namely his first entrance, and the serenade in the farmyard, were worthy of Rem' Claire at, his best, and the drive in the antiquated village taxi was a masterpiece of simple but effective clowning. We do not see enough of this polished comedian on the screen. Orders Is Orders was an excellent satire on the British military mind and the go-getting' methods of American film-producers. Cyril Maude was perfect as the Colonel, and James Gleason was pleasantly objectionable as Waggermeyer, the film magnate. A riotously funny film, and one which showed what British studios can do when they really try. Anna Neagle gave a splendid performance in the named part of Nell Gwyn. though sometimes her acting suffered from over-emphasis. Sir Cedric Hardwicke was perfectly cast as Charles II, and bore a most striking physical resemblance to the Merry Monarch. Some of the photography in this film was outstandingly good, and the costumes were both picturesque and true to I he period. First Division News. DECEMBER. Thirty-eight civil and sixty criminal cases came before the Kuching Courts during December. Of the latter, twenty-two were for breaches of Municipal By-laws. Two inquests were held in Kuching during the month. The first, on the body of an unknown Chinese who was found hanging from a tree in a rubber garden oil Sekama Road, resulted in a verdict of suicide during temporary insanity. At the second, on the body of a Chinese girl named Chok Nyin Tai, who had swallowed tuba poison, a verdict of suicide during temporary insanity was also recorded. Native Officer Abang Dan, on transfer from Lundu to Simunjan, reported his arrival in Kuching on December 23rd. The Assistant District Officer, Mr. G. F. J. Pegler proceeded to Lundu via Sibut Laut, Rambungan and Sampadi on the 17th, and returned to Kuching by the same route on December 24th. During the first week of December, a man, possibly a Lanun, was seen wandering along the coast off Tanjong Setimi in the vicinity of Telok Melanu. The mun was dumb, naked, and verging on collapse through starvation ; when brought to Lundu, it was found he was able to write, and by this means information was obtained that he and nine others bad sailed from Labuan, and when off Tanjong Datu had been wrecked. He was the sole, survivor The man has refused to indicate the name of his village in Labuan, the date of sailing from that port, or his destination. He is now under observation in the General Hospital. There is a possibility that he may be a fugitive from justice from Netherlands East Indies who lias concocted the story of the wreck off Tanjong Datu, and is feigning dumbness to avoid being arrested. On December full a petition was submitted by the inhabitants of Kampong Quop begging Government to rescind immediately the licence granted to a Chinese to maintain a gambling farm in the village. This request was made on the grounds that the farm was the cause of much annoyance, discontent and worry to the villagers. The District Officer. Bau, reports that there has been no serious crime in the district during December. The general health of the Bau district during the month was good. A great deal of anti-malarial work is being carried out, and as a result the incidence of malaria in the mines has noticeably decreased. 364 cases were treated in the Ban hospital and dispensary during December, and 73 N.A.B. injections were given, chiefly for yaws. The Principal Medical Officer made his usual monthly inspection of the gold mines on December 11th and 12th. The Orang Kaya of Senah (left-hand branch) again reports that Dayaks from Dutch territory have been making trouble in his district and encroaching on the Senah farming-land. It is hoped to arrange a meeting with the Dutch authorities as soon as possible to settle this question. Dalian Rubber Estates, Ltd., harvested 24,500 lbs. of dry rubber during December. The rainfall at Ban was 10.63 inches, and at Dahan 13.80 inches. During the month the B.C.L structure at Pangkalan Buso was demolished, since it had been condemned as dangerous to shipping. Two bridges on the Buso Hoad were strengthened. The carpenters were further engaged in repairing and filling water-pipes in the bazaar, and in minor alterations around the District Officer's bungalow for anti-malarial purposes. At the beginning of the month head warder Sajan Singh arrived at Bau and took over the jail from head warder Dal Singh, who has retired from the service. The new Chinese School at Paku is now finished, but owing to the recent destruction of the bazaar by fire, the committee have found some difficulty in meeting the cost. In view of the fact, also, that several of the committee have been compelled to move out of the Paku district, a new committee has now been formed to set the school on a firm footing and to obtain a new and more efficient master. On December 11th the. Government Auditor. Mr. A. G. Taylor, arrived at Ban to carry out the annual audit. He returned to Kuching on the 16th. The total output of gold for Upper Sarawak during November showed a slight increase on that of October, and amounted to 2,296.285 ozs. The price of gold remains steady at about $59.25 per fine oz. Two Exclusive Prospecting Licences, one Panning Licence, and one General Prospecting Licence were issued during December. The individual output of gold from the various mines for the month of November was as follows :— Rugby. On the evening of December 30th a rugger match, the first for over two years, was played in Kuching. The teams chosen were originally nine strong, but as usual various defaulters dropped out for one reason or another, one miscreant actually bringing forward work as an excuse for not playing. Others had almost equally ingenious excuses. At one time it looked, thanks to a last-minute backslider, that the teams would even drop below the regulation seven-a-side, but Cargill, risking the recurrence of on old injury, sportingly turned out and one of our defaulters thought better of it and came along. The teams that eventually took the field were : Referee W. H. Kelley. To even the sides Lowe changed to the Whites at half-time. The "gate” was very gratifying; a distinguished gathering of spectators gave continual encouragement to the teams. The betting remained fairly steady, the promising look of the Colours backs being counterbalanced by the solid appearance of the “All Black” forward opposition. Although the majority of players were badly out of training the game was fast and the tackling remarkably keen. The touch-kicking was, on the whole, poor, but the players showed a pleasing tendency to run or kick-ahead rather than resort to touch-line methods. Mitchell kicked off for the Colours who were soon in their opponents half, and Taylor was up to take a return pass from Lowe and cross near the corner. Mitchell kicked a good goal. Give and take play followed, both sides being dangerous in turn, till, just on half-time. Mitchell, fielding a long kick on the touch-line, beat his man and ran unchallenged from the centre to score a good try. Half-time thus came with the Colours leading by 8—nil. To the second half the superiority of the Whites forwards was clearly marked and they continued to get the best of the scrums. Good tackling by the Colours backs, however, held the opposition in check. Whites had the best of this half territorially hut. Colours scored twice, thanks to two beak-aways by Selons, probably the fittest man on the field. On the first occasion he fastened on to a dropped pass in his own half of the field, and following up a series of lusty kicks, he was first up to touch down. On the second occasion taking a pass from one of his own side, he ran from just inside centre, hotly pursued by Tait, to score between the posts, Mitchell converting. Towards the end the Whites pressed hotly and had bad luck more than once. On one occasion a free kick by Kitto, just missing the comer, went into touch-in-goal, and later Kitto and Noakes rushing the ball to the line were very unlucky not to score, in fact, Colours were extremely lucky not to have a penalty try awarded against them. The end of ten extremely hot and thirsty minutes either way, came with Colours victorious by two goals, two tries, 16 points to nil. For the winners Cargill was very good, always doing clover things and Mitchell played a sound game. Selous, playing in the back division shewed his versatility and was always up with the ball, his two tries were well taken. For the Whites, Noakes and Kitto were best, the latter though the "father” of the two teams proved he could still show the youngsters a trick or two. All the Whites forwards followed up excellently. The losers were unlucky to have Whale, their captain, off the field for some time owing to an unfortunate injury. Finally a word of thanks must be given tn Kelley who shewed tact and discretion in the thankless post of referee. Thanks are also due to him for the use of the Police padang. The game, ten minutes either way, was played in gym shoes and no place kicking was allowed It was so much enjoyed by the spectators and so well survived by the two teams that it is a pity a game or two more could not be arranged. A little determination and a little effort to overcome the general sloth of the East is all that is required.—(Contributed.) Seventh Day Adventist Mission. ITEMS OF NEWS. The Sunny Hill School, located at the 3rd mile, Hock Road, gave a very successful programme and concert at the close of November. The concert was repeated on December 1, at which performance Her Highness the Ranee and Dayang Valerie were present. The concert throughout revealed unusual ability. A feature outstanding on the programme were numbers by the Land Dayak boys of the Ayer Manis Schoo) at the 37th mile. Simanggang Road. The English was unusually good, and the singing of Mrs. B. Fox and a quartette was a real treat for Kuching. The boys of the Sunny Hill School presented a splendid American-Indian Ghost Dance : the girls featured in a hoop dull. Credit for the success of the event must go to Mr. and Mrs. L. Fox, Mr. and Mrs. Tan Tsak Yu, and the faculty, all of whom spared no time, or energy to produce a concert outstanding among local schools. Responding to a call to become the Director of the Malav Stales Mission at Kuala Lumpur. Pastor V. E. Hendershot. M.A., left Kuching by the Vyner Brooke on December 14. During his short stav in Kuching Professor Hendershot has made a host of friends, whose good wishes follow him to his new post.—(Contributed.) The following contributions to the Welfare Work of the S.D.A. Mission in Sarawak were received at the end of 1935, for which grateful acknowledgment is herewith tendered : Persaudara'an Sehabat Pena, Malaya (Sarawak Branch). A large gathering assembled at the first Annual Gencral Meeting of the above-named Association which was held at the residence of Incite Mohd. Zain bin Malek, at Jalan Patinggi Alli, on 5th January, 1936. Those present included the Datu Amar, Incite Abu Bakar (pensioner), Abg. Hj. Zaini. several other guests and members of the Association which, in all, numbered about eightypersons. After a group photograph had been taken, Incite Mohd. Zain made a short speech of welcome and thanked those who had kindly spared their time to be present at the gathering. He then asked Incite Mohd. Norwawi bin Haili, the Secretary of the Association, to come forward and proceed with the meeting. Inche Mohd. Norwawi, alter saying a few words thanking the guests on behalf of the Association, read a short resume written by Inche Mohd. Zain relating to the formation of the Association. lie continued at length, in classical Malay, and explained to the audience the object of the gathering taking the opportunity to express the meaning of the words Persaudara'an Sehabat Pena which was appreciated by all present. The Datu, in the course of his well-worded speech, expressed his delight at the success of the organisers in forming up the Association and kindly consented to be its President. Abg. Hj. Zaini also spoke on behalf of the guests thanking the members of the Association for their kind invitation. After the speech, the guests were regaled to a curry tiffin delightfully prepared by Nana A. K. Hussien. The S. C. Orchestra under the leadership of P.P.I. Awang Joini and Sergt.-Major Mohamed was in attendance and helped to enliven the occasion. The election of Office-bearers for the year 1936 resulted as follows :— President ...

The match Benson vs. Kitto was notable for a great recovery by Benson in the second set, when, with one set down and trailing 2-5 he put on a spurt and took the set at 8-6. However, he could not reproduce this form in the third set when he was beaten by his opponent's superior placements. In the final Cargill was rather unlucky in the first set as he was leading 5-4 and had set point, but he faltered and allowed Kitto just to win the set at 7-5. Cargill can play a fast low shot from his backhand court to his opponent’s forehand court along the side-line; this is about the most difficult shot in tennis, and one he should practise as it is a sure match-winner.—(Contributed.)

Two hundred and six out-patients were treated at Simanggang Government Dispensary during December, and one hundred and forty N.A.B. injections were performed. All Penghulus and Orang Kaya visited Simanggang during the month and were present at a preliminary aum with various tuai, held by Mr. Arundell. The object of the aum was to codify the different Dayak adats of the Second Division; the final aum is to be held next month when His Highness the Rajah visits Simanggang. Several cases of theft were reported in the Saribas district during December. One Dayak woman visitor from Singapore complained that $80 had been stolen from her person; the circumstances appeared peculiar, but the police were unable to discover any clue. One hundred and twenty-six out-patients were treated at Betong Dispensary during December, and forty eight X A.B injections were administered. Abang Draup, Senior Native Officer, Betong, visited the Uluu Layar and Spak to make further enquiries into the rice shortage. On his return he reported that the situation was very serious and estimated that six hundred sacks of rice would be required. It was considered, however, that this estimate was excessive, and arrangements were made to obtain a hundred sacks of rice at $6.50 per sack. It was proposed to issue this rice on credit, but at the. end of the month information was received that rebels had been harboured in the Ulu Spak, and the issue of rice has been postponed, pending a full investigation in the Ulu. The sale of cartridges was completely stopped at the end of the month. Reports on this year's padi in the Saribas district continue to be satisfactory. On Christmas Day, Stambak Ulu, the winners of the Saribas Dayak Football Cup, met an XI composed of Betong Government servants. After a hard tussle Government won by one goal, the final score being 1—0. Visitors to Betong during the month included the Ven. Archdeacon F. S. Hollis and the Rev. Father O. Philipps. The Acting District Officer, Kalaka, visited the Awek and Krian during the month, accompanied by Pengarah Nyalu, and reports that prospects for the padi harvest appear good ; the padi looks healthy, but many complaints were received about the ravages of mice. Towards the end of the month there was considerable activity in Saratok bazaar, the construction of many new shop-houses being started. The Native Officer. Engkilili, states that dealers are storing their pepper in the hope of obtaining better prices later on. Prisoner Chai Lan, who escaped from Engkilili jail on October 31st. 1934. was re-captured on the Simanggang Road by Mr. E. H. Elam, and sent back to Engkilili under escort. It is understood that this man’s re-capture was due to a chance encounter, and to the fact that he was recognized by Mr. Elam, who was in charge of Engkilili when lie escaped. Fifty levies under the leadership of Penglmlus Briak. Sirai, and Bedembap arrived at Lubok Antu from Katibas via Nanga Mujang on December 18th. returning on 23rd. They were accompanied by Penghulu Ramba and Rantai. Third Division News. DECEMBER Twenty-six civil and fifty-four criminal cases came before the Sibu Courts during December. On December 14th a report was received from Kanowit that two wayang actresses had committed suicide by jumping into the river, opposite the Fort, from a vessel conveying them and other members of their troupe back to Sibu. The Assistant District Officer accompanied by Inspector Abang Adeng proceeded to Kanowit to hold an inquiry. A verdict of suicide while of unsound mind was returned. Both bodies were eventually recovered and identified. Mr. A. Macpherson. Travelling District Officer, left for the Kanowit district on the 5th. returning to Sibu on the 21st accompanied by Native Officer Wan Bujang and several Dayak tuai from the I'm and Ngemah. Land revenue amounted to $9,698.83 for the Sibu district only, as compared with $8,584.29 for the previous month. The Acting Superintendent of Lauds and Surveys. Mr. W. Harnack, visited Sibu from 10th to 12th December. The following figures give the Sibu and Kanowit trade figures for the mouth : Hobber exports from the Division for the month were us follows :— Repairs were effected to the wireless station at Kanowit during the month, the carpenter and coolies with timber and materials being transported thence in the motor-lighter Big Bill. The District Officer, Sibu, reports that Forest Ranger Pendek returned on the 7th from further exploration and demarcation of the Pelagus Protected Forest. The Dayaks living at Nanga Iran were interviewed and the change of boundary explained by the Penghulu and the Forest Hanger. They asked for both banks of the Sungci Latong below Nanga Rusa and these have been excluded from the reserve and a revised proclamation for the area has been posted. Forest Ranger Pendek and a small party are leaving for Pelagus early in the New Year to explore and demarcate the boundary from Nanga Arak (Pelagus) to the ulu Latong Kiri and to survey this stream down to Nanga Rosa. All reasonable requests of the natives living in the immediate neighbourhood of the protected area have now been investigated and acceded to in most cases. Final demarcation should now smoothly. the Menyong and Bah-Sama Protected were gazetted during the month, totalling acres. proceed Both Forests 108.000 The Forest Guard at Sarikei carried out a reconnaisance of a small area of old jungle on the Divisional boundary in the neighbourhood of Bukit Tibak Sirat in the ulu Sarikei. The question of a suitable method of protecting such a small area of jungle as a timber reserve for certain houses in the ulu Sarikei is still under discussion. There is a similar area to be examined in the ulu Stras (Binatang). The licences exploiting compartment 1 in Bukit Lima reserve is supplying the roofing timbers for the new Sibu hospital. The timber is to be Meraka, and the Divisional Forest Officer visited the area and selected and marked the trees for felling. Conversion is by hand-sawing. Now that this limber is becoming known it is gaining popularity locally, especially for launch building. The timber is little inferior to Semayur. and there is an almost unlimited supply in the Rejang delta. Seventy-one new patients were admitted to Sibu hospital during the month, and sixty-nine were discharged, hour hundred and forty-nine outpatients received treatment. Fifty-three N.A.B. injections were performed. Mrs J. M. Hoover left for Singapore via Kuching on the 19th by M.v. Rejang. Her departure means a great, loss to the community, and she leaves behind her a host of friends who wish her 'bon voyage’ and all possible happiness in the future. On the 28th Mr. F. L. G. Crossley and Mr. A. R. Snelus sailed from Sarikei in M.T.. Chamois to Rejang to meet H.M.S. Lowestoft tConiinmider A. R. M. Bridge), and returned on New Year's eve with Commander Bridge, three other officers, and eight other ranks. A very festive evening was spent. and the New Year was welcomed in the time-honoured fashion, the presence of the party from H.M.S Lowestoft adding very considerably to the success of the occasion. They sailed for Rejang at noon the next day in ML. Chamois and Irene. The District Officer. Rejang, reports that after five days' hearing, a charge of criminal breach of trust against the manager of a Binatang trading company was adjourned for consultation with the Divisional Treasurer. In the Bankruptcy Court considerable time was spent in hearing and deciding claims against the estate of Chop Hock Eng Hong of Binatang. Apart from evasions of the Rubber Restriction Orders, and a few petty thefts, there was little crime in the Lower Rejang district during the month. All Penghulus came down to Sarikei or Binatang during the month, and reported all well in their districts. Rumah Lingoh of the ulu Sarikei was ordered to be broken up, the villagers to join other longhouses. owing to constant quarrelling and concealment from the Penghulu of offenders against Dayak customary law . The Tua-Tua Kampong of Daro and Bawang. Matu, tendered their resignations on the plea that they have been refused a monthly salary and work on commission only. The resignations were not accepted. but it is felt that there will be difficulty in retaining the services of non-salaried Tna Kampong while the old Tua Kampong are still being paid a monthly salary. Reports from the coast indicate that the padi crop will not he very successful. In spite of the continued low price of pepper, there were 35 applications for new pepper gardens in Sarikei. Exports from Sarikei and Binatang during Decemlier were as follows .— A contracl was signed for the construction of a new police station at Kelupu. on the Binatang river.

Earth-filling in front of the Sarikei godown was completed, and the surface gravelled. H.M.S. Lowestoft., a sloop of 1,000 tons, arrived at Kuala Rejang on the 29th. and anchored off Jerijeh. The District Officer and Mr. A. R. Snelus went on board as soon as she anchored, and met Commander Bridge and his officers. It appears that Lowestoft is on a cruise from Singapore along the North Coast of Borneo to Hong Kong, and is taking the opportunity of checking some of the survey marks put up by H.M.S. Herald. On the 31st the ship entered the river and anchored off Rejang. On the same day the Commander, with three officers and eight ratings, travelled up to Sibu on S.L. Chamois for a short visit. The Director of Public Works visited Sarikei on the 4th for consultation concerning the wharf and godowns with Mr. Sehested, of Gammons. Ltd., who was in Sarikei from the 2nd to the 4th. The Survey Office in Binatang was closed down on the 16th, and Mr. G. A. Farrelly left for Sibu. Land settlement proceeded steadily in Sarikei, and ordinary land routine work is sufficiently heavy to keep a large, stall fully occupied. The Acting Superintendent of lands and Surveys, Mr. W. Harnack, visited Sarikei and Binatang on the 8th and 9th. One ease of major incest came before the Court at Kapit during December. The guilty parties were fined in accordance with Dayak customary law. The District Officer, Kapit, reports that the migration of pigs across the Batang Rejang is still continuing; this is the third month nf the migration, which is said to be unprecedented even in the memory of the old men of the district. Penghulu Ansi reported that a girl of about ten years had been taken by a crocodile from Rumah Empurau (Pala Wong district); news waa also received that the wife of Tuai Rumah Lobang and another woman were drowned when their small prahu over-turned in rapids above Nanga Balang (Ga'at district). Three rhinoceros horns were brought to Kapit by Dayaks from Rumah Blikau towards the end of the month. A large quantity of rattan was exported from Song during the month. Owing to continued high water, the stores for the Ga'at blockhouses were taken up to Nanga Stapang by outboard on December 9th, and Native Officer Abang Ahmat and L.C. Emban mailed themselves of this opportunity to visit the blockhouse, returning the next day. The District Officer. Mukah, reports that there seems to be a certain amount of fever at the station, possibly malarial. Dayak padi and jagong are reported to be doing well in the ulu Oya, but as usual pigs and rats are causing considerable damage. The price of raw sago dropped a few cents during the month. The average price was 61 cents per passu at Sungei Kut. and 52 cents at Dalat. 94 1/2. koyans of raw sago. 20 pikuls of rubber and 140 pikuls nf jelutong were shiped from Oya district by sen; and 98 koyans of raw sago were shipped through Sungei Kut.

The Resident, Fourth Division, left for Haram on D cember 5th, and returned to Miri on the 9th. Baram Station had been almost entirely flooded for the past three weeks, and the appearance of the bazaar and kampongs was most distressing. The Native Officers informed the Resident that, in their opinion, the floods were becoming worse every year, and that such long and disastrous inundations had seldom occurred in the past. It seems possible that the gradual clearing of jungle and drainage upriver is the cause, and there seems to be little hope for the future. Accompanied by the District Officer and Tuanku Taha, the Resident inspected land alongside the Limbang Road with a view to moving the entire Malay population on the Fort side of the river there. The ground is above flood level but of poor quality, mostly sand and shale; this, however, would not be a definite drawback, the main obstacle being the lack of water. If the move was approved. Government would have to erect a water supply station, but this should not be difficult. It is reported that Vamco Ltd., the sawmill at Bakong controlled by Messrs. Cook and Doughty, is working at full pressure, and can take no more orders. Messrs. Cutfield. Hudden, and Scott, visited Miri for Christmas. A District Officers' meeting, at which a number of matters were discussed was held on December 24th. The only absentee was Mr. J. 0. Gilbert. District Officer. Bintulu, who was unable to be present. In his report for December, the Resident. Fourth Division, mentions that it is remarkable how the number of prisoners in the Division has decreased in the past few years. Seventy-one out-patients were treated at Limbang Government Dispensary during December, and thirty-one N.A.B. injections were given. The District Officer. Limbang and Lawns, reports that a few Kelabits from the Ulu Medihit visited Limbang for the first lime for many months. These people had been preparing for this trip, or bad been actually on their way since the middle of September, but were constantly held up by bad omens. Thesesame omens and their superstitions were also responsible for many of these people, especially those from Bulling Imat's house, failing to harvest any of their crops last year. The party spent only three nights in Limbang, and then commenced the return journey. A number of Dayaks also came down, mostly bringing rattans, but they reported that they could get no price for this commodity, and in many cases the Chinese traders would not even make them an offer for it. Padi crops in the Limbang district generally look very healthy, and the recent fine weather should help to ripen the padi quickly. There has been almost a glut on the market of entimun and other vegetables grown by Kadayans. Awang bin Gador. who escaped from custody in 1931. was recaptured in the Ulu Tutong and was returned to Limbang thunks to the assistance of the Brunei Police. A big Chinese wedding was solemnised at Limbang on the 11th, when the Capitan China's son was married to a daughter of the late Mr. Soon Keng. The marriage and celebrations were on a very large scale for a place the size of Limbang. A rough draft of Bisayah. Murut, and Tabun fines and customs was completed at Limbang during the month. The price of damar at Bintulu has fallen, but it is hoped that this is only a temporary drop. The District Officer reports that the natives still seem prosperous, and that during the period before Hari Raya plenty of money was spent; certainly there were lavish display- of lanterns and other decorations in rhe kampongs. The increase of the native population at Bintulu will shortly reader a new kampong scheme necessary. It is hoped to demarcate a kampong between Sebiew river and the Sarawak Timber & Trading Company's concession. Work on the drainage of the Bintulu landingground (first stage) was completed during the month. After the visit of Mr. R. E. Edwards, of the Public Works Department, it was decided that the perimeter and cross drains should be deepened to a depth of two feet. Work lias also started on a trial patch of the landing-ground with the object of removing all roots and top soil until sand is reached. A regatta was held at Bintulu on Christmas Day. but it was purely a local affair, no outside boats competing. The regatta went off very successfully, and ended with a display of tireworks in the evening. This display appeared to be appreciated by the Dayaks present more than any of the other events. Arrangements have been made with the Sarawak Steamship Co.. Ltd., for m.v. Margaret to call at Kuala Bintulu in the course of each trip North and Smith. This greatly improves the mail service of the Station. Bintulu. indeed, now has weekly mail service with Singapore. Trade still looks good, and the two steamers in direct communication with Singapore continue to bring io and take out satisfactory cargoes. The body of a Chinese girl named Chia Ah Kia was found in Baram River on December 1st. and an inquest was held next day. A verdict of suicide whilst of unsound mind was returned, but. since there was insufficient evidence to prove that she had deliberately drowned herself, this was later revised to one of death by misadventure. The District Officer, Baram. reports that on December 23rd Chin Leong, a suspected leper, attempted to burn down a shophouse in Long Lama, but the flumes were discovered and extinguished. Apparently he has been suspected to lie leprous for some time, but has always resisted with violence any Digestion for 8 hours at local room temperature(29° c.) with occasional shaking has been foundto be sufficient.

His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valeric arrived at Kuching on November 23rd. having travelled from Singapore by s.s. Vyner Brooke. As this vessel passed Fort Margherita at about 10.15 a.m. a salute of twenty-one guns was fired from the Fort Battery, and as soon as she dropped anchor opposite Astana the Siamese State Barge came alongside with His Highness the Tuan Muda. Mr H. B. Crocker, Acting Govern¬ ment Secretary, Mr. H. M. Calvert, Acting Treasurer of Sarawak, Mr. W. F. Dick, Resident, First Division, and His Highness the Rajah's Aide-de-Camp on board. After an exchange of greetings His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie were rowed in the State Barge to the Astana pengkalan, where they were met by members of the Committee" of Administration and Supreme Council. After His Highness the Rajah had in¬ spected the Constabulary guard of honour which was drawn up on Astana lawn under the command of the Adjutant, His Highness proceeded to Astana, where Heads of Govern¬ ment Departments and representatives of all communities—European, Malay, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian—were gathered. Re¬ freshments were served, and after a short speech of welcome the healths of His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie were proposed by Mr. H. B. Crocker and drunk by all present. His Highness replied in a few words and shortly afterwards the guests dispersed. We take this opportunity of welcoming His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie back to Sarawak. Advice has been received by telegram that Her Highness the Ranee sailed from Marseilles in the P.&O. s.s. Rajputana on November 13th. Her Highness is expected to arrive in Kuching on December 7th. On November 5th a daughter was born to the Earl and Countess of Inchcape, to whom we tender our congratulations. On hearing the good news the Government Secretary despatched the following telegram to the Government Agent. London :— "Please convey to Dayang Leonora and Lord Inchcape congratulations of Sarawak Government officers and all communities on birth of daughter.” and on November 30th the following letter was received from the Countess of Inchcape (Dayang Leonora): 91, PARK STREET, Mayfair, W.l, November 17th. "DEAR MR. CROCKER, I want to thank you and the Sarawak Government officers for your kind cable of congra¬ tulations on the birth of our daughter Rosemary. Will you please convey to everyone as best you can on behalf of Lord Inchcape and myself our sincere thanks at your kind interest in our family ? Yours sincerely, LEONORA." His Highness the Tuan Muda and Dayang Anne, who are travelling to Europe by air, left for Singapore by s.s. Darnel on Novem¬ ber 28th. Both His Highness and Dayang Anne originally intended to return to Europe via China and Siberia, but the receipt of dis¬ quieting news regarding the health of the Ranee Margaret caused them to change their plans. Her Highness the Ranee’s autobiography, which has recently been published, has been very favourably reviewed in the Press. We print one of the notices elsewhere in this issue. The book, the title of which is "Sylvia of Sarawak : an Autobiography," is published by Messrs. Hutchinson at 18/-. It is, of course, of particular interest to those ac¬ quainted with Sarawak, but the subject- matter is so interesting and it is so entertain¬ ingly written that it has a general appeal, and will be appreciated, we are sure, by a very wide circle of readers. Major W. C. Adams, Commandant of the British North Borneo Armed Constabulary, spent a week-end in Kuching on his way from Singapore to Jesselton as the guest of Mr. D. V. Murphy. Another visitor to Kuching during the month was Mr. J. A. P. Strachan, the Chairman of Directors of United Engineers. Ltd. November was distinguished by the unusual number of Europeans who returned from furlough. These included Mr. and Mrs. E. Parnell, Mr. and Mrs. A. W. G. Gibson, Mr. and Mrs. R. L. Daubeny, and Mr. D. MacDonald, Manager of Sungei Tengah Estate. Captain and Mrs. C. P. Lowe also arrived back in Kuching after a trip to Japan, Captain Lowe having recently been granted six week’s sick leave. Mr. E. Parnell resumed duty in the Treasury on November 23rd, and Mr. H. M. Calvert, who had been acting as Treasurer of Sarawak during Mr. Parnell’s absence on furlough, took over the Trade and Customs Department from Mr. L. D. Kennedy on the 25th. Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy left on furlough by s.s. Darvel on November 28th. On Saturday, November 28th, the St. Andrew's Society of Sarawak held their annual celebration in the shape of a dinner and dance at the Sarawak Club. The guests , assembled in the main hall of the Chib at 8.30 p.m. for paints, and about three-quarters of an hour later no less than seventy persons sat down to an excellent dinner, complete, of course, with the traditional haggis, The traditional accompaniment, too? was not wanting, and served to bring out the best in the excellent fare provided. The “Pious Memory of St. Andrew” and “The Rajah" were proposed by Mr. James Scott, the Chieftain; Mr. Boyd proposed "The King," and Messrs, Dickson and Cordiner gave us “The Guests” and “The Lassies” respectively, each toast being pre¬ ceded with an admirable speech. Mr. Crocker replied on behalf of the guests, and Mrs. Calvert gave a neat and pointed reply to “The Lassies.” After dinner, reels, petronellas and other barbaric dances were performed to the strains of the pipes.—produced through the agency of a wax disc and the Club’s amplifier With so many Scotsmen among us it seems a pity that Kuching cannot produce even one wee chanter,—particularly since so much of our musical talent comes from the Scots community. Nevertheless the ersatz pipes of the amplifier produced the true hie'land at¬ mosphere, and the festivities continued until the small hours; in some cases, indeed, it is whispered that they continued until the following day On the Sunday morning the Scots look on the Sassenachs at golf and beat them 8 1/2 to 4 1/2, thereby proving, in Kuching at any rate, that the Sassenachs are as much a match for them at their national game as they are at their national drink. But after the delight¬ ful evening the Sassenachs had enjoyed they did not grudge their hosts of the previous night their victory. We extend a hearty welcome to Mr. D. MeNiven who arrived in Kuching on Novem¬ ber 9th in order to take over the Agency of the Chartered Bank from Mr. J. M. Allan, who sailed on home leave on November 26th. As it is unlikely that Mr. Allan will be returning to Sarawak, we take this oppor¬ tunity of wishing him bon voyage and the best of luck in the future. Mr. R. L. Daubeny has been appointed District Officer, Kuching, and has taken over the affairs of the Kuching District from Mr. G. F. J. Pegler, who has been appointed to act as Travelling District Officer. First Division. The Vyner Brooke had an exceptionally rough passage when bringing His Highness the Rajah and Dayang Valerie from Singa¬ pore ; seas were breaking over the forecastle even before the ship passed the Horsburgh light, and when she reached the open sea conditions became very much worse. The rough weather, however, did not delay her, and she dropped anchor opposite Astana punctually at 10.30 a.m. on the 23rd. We welcome to Sarawak Mr. and Mrs. H. P. Lansdale-Ruthven, who arrived at Kuching on November 9th. Mr. Ruthven has been appointed Legal Adviser and Registrar, Supreme Court. On November 12th an R.A.F. flying boat arrived at Pending from Singapore with Squadron-Leaders L. Darvall and R. A. George and several other R.A.F. officers. She returned to Singapore the following morning. The second anniversary of the Sylvia Cinema occurred on November 24th, and elsewhere in this issue will be found a brief review of some of the films that have been shown there during the past two years. The Sylvia Cinema has proved of immense value to all communities and has long been recog¬ nized as one of the greatest amenities of Kuching. This year for the first time we shall be able to send Hari Raya and Christmas greeting telegrams inside Sarawak at the remarkably low cost of 25 cents for the first ten words and 3 cents for each extra word. It will be interesting to see the extent to which the public will avail itself of this new service. On November 6th the Rev. Father J. Staal, Rector of the R.C. Mission, Serian, returned from European furlough by s.s. Borebat, and proceeded to Serian a few days later. Mr. A. F. Baughan arrived at. Kuching on November 30th to take over the manage¬ ment of Messrs. Sime, Darby & Co., Ltd., from Mr. G. J. Dickson, who is shortly leav¬ ing to become Manger of the firm’s branch at Ipoh. Mr. Baughan, of course, was Assis¬ tant Manager of Sime, Darby’s local branch in 1929 and 1930, and wc welcome him back to Sarawak. STOP PRESS. We announce with the deepest regret that on the morning of December 2nd a telegram was received communicating the news of the death of Her Highness the Ranee Margaret. Government offices throughout the State were immediately closed as a mark of respect, and flags were half-masted, and in Kuching the Sylvia Cinema was closed on the night of December 2nd on His Highness the Rajah’s personal instructions. His Highness the Rajah has directed that mourning is to be worn by all Government officers for a period of one week, commencing from December 2nd. We understand that the funeral of Her Highness the Ranee Margaret will take place at South Ascot on Saturday, December 5th, in accordance with Her late Highness’ wishes. The funeral service will be held in London on December 4th. On behalf of all our readers we take this opportunity of extending to His Highness the Rajah and all members of His Highness’ family our deepest and most sincere sympathy in their great loss. An obituary notice appears below. HER HIGHNESS THE RANEE MARGARET. OBITUARY. We announce with the most profound regret the death of Her Highness the Ranee Margaret, which occurred at her home in England on December 1st. Until only a few weeks ago Her Highness had been in the best, of health and spirits, but towards the end of November she had a sudden illness, and her condition gave rise to serious anxiety. On receipt, of this news His Highness the Tuan Muda, who had intended to travel to Europe via Siberia, changed his plans and decided to fly home, but the end came earlier than was expected. A telegram received on November 30th stated that although the Rance Margaret’s condition showed very little change, she was gradually losing ground, and at 9 p.m. on December 1st an announcement on the Wireless News conveyed to His Highness the Rajah and the people of Sarawak the sad tidings that the Ranee Margaret had died some twelve hours earlier. This was confirmed by telegram on the following morning. The Ranee Margaret was born in Paris on October 9th, 1649. She spent her childhood at the Chateau d’Epinay-sur-Orge, the home of the Baronne de Windt, whose name her English father subsequently took on marrying into the family. Later on the Chateau d’Epinay was sold and the Ranee Margaret and her parents came to live in Wiltshire. In 1869 she first met Sir Charles Brooke (then Mr. Brooke) who was her mother’s cousin and who two years previously had succeeded Sir James Brooke as second Rajah of Sarawak. The Rajah and she were married on October 28th, 1869, after a somewhat unconventional courtship, and a few months later they set sail Tor Sarawak. The Rance was a woman of quite exceptional courage and good humour, and it was as well that she possessed these qualities since Sarawak in 1870 was no bed of roses for a girl of twenty accustomed to the life of a French Chateau and an English country house. Amenities which we now take for granted were then non-existent, and conditions generally were primitive in the extreme: indeed, it is difficult to imagine the reactions of a young Englishwoman such as the Ranee suddenly trans¬ ported from the grace and calm of the English countryside to the Sarawak of nearly seventy years ago. The experience must have been a trifle over¬ whelming, to say the least of it. hut any fears that the Rajah may have entertained regarding his young bride’s attitude to the new and strange fife to which he was bringing her were soon dispelled. The Ranee Margaret loved Sarawak from the first moment of her arrival, and this love, which was deep-rooted and true, remained undimmed to (lie end. Her writings describe her feelings of wonder and delight at her first glimpse of the coast, and thia sense of joyous adventure survived all the monotony that is an inevitable concomitant of life in a small settlement in the tropics, and enabled her to find fresh interest and amusement in every day that passed. It was indeed a case of love at first sight; in Sarawak and its people she found something that made a deep appeal to her warm and generous nature, something that struck a responsive chord in her heart and evoked all the sympathy and understanding that she could bestow in such overflowing measure. And her love was abundantly returned The Malays, who were instantly her friends and whose confidence she gained at her first meeting with them, treasure her memory to this day. They saw in her not the wife of a European ruler, regal and remote, but a gracious lady who identified herself heart and soul with the country of her adoption, and who put the interests of its people always before her own. So greatly did she value her friendship with the Malays, and so deeply did she treasure the memory of her association with them, that in her later years she never tired of hearing news of her Malay friends, their children, and their children’s children; and only a few weeks before her death she sent to the Malays of Sarawak a message of greeting and affection, saying that although it was such a long time since she had seen them, and although she lived so far away, she would never forget them, and hoped that they would not forget her. She need have had no fear. The European community of Kuching in the year of the Ranee Margaret’s arrival consisted of three married couples and five or six bachelors. Communications with the outside world were irregular and uncertain, most of the comforts of civilised life were larking, and amusements were few. The Ranee Margaret, however, instead of lapsing into boredom, made her own amusements, and found in the country and in the Malay’s an inexhaustible store of intereat. She was adored by the Malay ladies of Kuching, who frequented the Astana regularly, and who delighted in her society, and did much to relieve what must otherwise have seen a life of some loneliness; in those troubled days the Rajah was often absent for long periods either on expeditions, or else attending to out- station problems. The Ranee, however, did not always stay in Kuching,—even in those days of rough and uncertain travel she managed to visit outstations, and indeed she was onoe confined in Sibu fort during a scare that followed Lintong’s abortive attack. In her own account of this episode the Ranee tells how she and Ima, her little Malay maid, took refuge behind a piano while Sepoys and native fortmen loaded cannon and manned the loop-holes of the fort under the direction of Mr. Skelton, the Resident, who had successfully driven off Lintong’s forces a short while before.—An unusual experience for a voting married woman straight from England ! The Ranee also paid visits to Mukah and to Simang- gang, where she witnessed her first display of Dayak dancing, and where she was a trifle taken aback to see one of the performers nonchalantly produce a smoked head at one stage of the dance as though it were nothing more unusual than a pair of castanets. In April, 1875. the Ranee Margaret accom¬ panied the Rajah on his first visit to the Baram river, which at that time was a totally unknown and unexplored river under the rule—or rather mis¬ rule—of the Sultan of Brunei. This was such a remarkable journey that it is impossible to do justice to it here, and the Ranee’s own story of it is reproduced on another page. It makes' fasci¬ nating reading, and is a good example of the Ranee's courage and love of adventure. In the Ranee Margaret were united a vigorous intellect, a most vital personality, and an out- standing physical beauty. She was gifted by nature with a number of accomplishments, the chief of which was probably her skill at music, for which she had a profound love and a marked gift. At the tender age of four she first began to play the piano; at five could read music, and at seven she was launched into concerted music, and could take the piano parts of Mozart’s easier trios. Among her teachers were celebrities such as Arabella Goddard, Charles Hallé and even Thal- berg, all of whom spoke highly of her talents, and in later life she counted among her friends Edward Elgar, the composer, and W. H. Read, the well- known violinist. Tn 1931. at the age of 82, she was chosen with W. H. Read to record the Kreutzer sonata for the gramophone, and a year or two later she gave an organ recital at Queen’s Hall! According to Montaigne, It is the bodie which sometimes yeeldeth first unto age, and other times the mind’.—but in the Ranee Margaret’s case it was neither; until her last illness her magnificent vitality remained unimpaired. She refused to give way to advancing years, and until the end she remained what she had always been,— a very great lady such as we shall not easily see again in our time. The Ranee Margaret lived every phase of her life to the full, and got the best from each moment of it. Now, at the close of the long day, night has come, and she has fallen asleep. But though it is night, and she sleeps, her memory lives on. In her last book she wrote that when her time came, she hoped that a recording angel with a pen steeped in love and beauty might pass by where she rested and inscribe the word “Sarawak” in great golden letters across her heart. Her wish has surely come to pass, and just as surely must she know that her own name is written indelibly in the hearts of Sarawak's people. The Late Ranee Margaret. As a tribute to the memory of Her Highness the late Ranee Margaret we print below her own account of her visit to the Baram River in 1875,—surely one of the most remark¬ able journeys ever undertaken by an English¬ woman. The account is taken from her book “Good Morning and Good Night,” published by Messrs. Constable in 1934 :— Shortly after our return the Rajah decided to visit the Baram River, taking with him Mr. de Crespigny, the Borneo Company's Agent, my brother Mr. Harry de Windt and myself. The territory which lie intended to explore was situated further north than Sarawak’s most northerly possession, Bintulu, in Borneo, and was still at that time ruled over by the Sultan of Brunei. Now the tribe inhabiting the regions at the head of the Baram River were called Kayans, and were much given to foraging about and falling foul of Dyaks and other tribes who were subjects of the Rajah. As the Sultan of Brunei appeared to be powerless to control these Kayans and the outbreaks of hostilities were becoming all too frequent, the Rajah decided to go there, get in touch with the offending tribe and try to bring about a better state of things for everybody concerned, but especially for his own people who were being so constantly harassed. I don’t believe he quite knew what he would find there or what he was going to do. but he realized that the Kayans were badly governed and out of control, and would probably be glad to do us so many other tribes had done and become his subjects. Whatever was in the Rajah's mind, we all knew better than to ask him any questions, Had one of us attempted to do so the offender would no doubt have speedily found himself (or herself !) seated in one of the dinghies of the Heartsease being borne rapidly back to Kuching. Therefore as we sped on our journey, the sea being calm, we talked of shoes and ships and sealing-wax, of cabbages and kings, but never of the object of our quest. All that the Rajah vouchsafed to Mr. de Crespigny, when we were at breakfast that first day. was that he was taking me with him in order to impress upon the inhabitants of the Baram River district that his mission was a peaceful one, to which information we answered “Oh!" and went on eating. Funnily enough the prospect of a journey into unknown and savage country, peopled by totally ungovernable tribes, had no terror for me, so absolutely confident was I in my husband’s ability to deal with blood¬ thirsty and uncivilized offenders. Sometimes I almost longed for a slight spice of danger in such, to me, novel undertakings. But no! I always felt perfectly safe! When we arrived at the mouth of the hitherto unexplored Baram, members of the crew were sent off in ship’s boats to take soundings, to enable us to enter its uncharted waters. After hours of test¬ ing, when I saw at each dip the sounding poles standing high above the watermark with only a depth of two or three feet even at high tide, I began to despair, and think that we might be kept examin- ing the shallow entrance for days or even weeks, for I knew that the Rajah's patience was infinite and that he would not be turned back from accomplish¬ ing the purpose he had in view. There he sat with his three men companions, all smoking their horrible Manila cigars and staring at the unknown coast, debating about the possibilities of future trade in the fertile country inland. How little then did my husband foresee the benefits which would be con¬ ferred on Sarawak’s revenues in years to come by the discovery of the vast oil-fields on the sandy shores they gazed at from the deck of the Heartsease. At last, after many hours, shouts of triumph were heard from the exploring boats. The men waved their oars in the air; a channel had been found. But, alas, the yacht could not make her way in owing to her overdraught of water. However, the Borneo Company’s steamer, Sri Sarawak, which had accompanied the Heartsease in view of such a contingency, being able to negotiate the shallows, we all transferred into it, and slowly, very slowly, found ourselves over the bar and at last inside the river. The Heartsease was left outside at anchor, and we crawled along with infinite caution on our way up stream. Mr. de Crespigny, pencil and paper in hand, seated himself on the bridge in order to make a chart as the quartermaster called out bis soundings. Up and up we went. Now and then, beyond the vast forest lands, we would get glimpses of mountains blue in the distance. At first the course of the river was pretty straight. Then it began to wiggle and waggle in and out of its many bends, giving Mr. de Crespigny and his pencil a good deal of work. We were making for a somewhat important village called Batu Gading (Ivory Rock), which, the Rajah had been told by some of bis Kayan subjects near Kuching, stood a good way up. We parsed several villages, some long houses made of palm leaves with wooden walls were propped up by posts which at high tide stood in the water. Men, women and children were moving about, some of them pounding rice on the broad verandahs, while others paddled themselves about in canoes. They betrayed no surprise at the appearance of what, to them, was a hitherto unknown object—a ship with a smoking funnel steaming up their river. The Rajah pulled out his handkerchief and waved it repeatedly as we passed each village, bidding us all to do the same. The natives waved to us in return. We were getting along nicely and my husband was enjoying himself. That evening we anchored off one of these villages, but no sign of life appeared outside. As night came on and the sky was filled with stars, the most awful wails and shrieks began to issue from the wooden walls of the one long house which constituted the village. A corpse was lying inside and they were wailing for their dead. We had to stay where we had anchored as it was too dark for us to proceed, but what a gruesome night we spent! Even when we hauled up anchor at daybreak the wailing was still going on. "Ah, yes," said Mr. de Crespigny cheerily, as we steamed away, “in the midst of life we are in death !" The Rajah, who knew most of the customs of the different peoples of those parts, thought it likely that they belonged to a tribe called Muruts, whose custom it is on death occasions for the females to sit on the verandah opposite the room of the departed, cover their heads with cloths, and wail and moan, while the men visit each other and drink. The heads of the near female relations of the corpse are then shaved, after which the deceased is pushed into a large jar, the top is closed down and the jar is then covered with red cloth edged with tinsel. In the case of a chief ten years may elapse before the jar is buried in their graveyard, the ceremony being accompanied by much firing of guns and many rejoicings, In the interval between the death and the burial, the jar is placed on a wooden platform, erected a few yards from the house. My brother wished that he. could have had a peep at the cere¬ mony, unknown to the people, but I thought it all very gruesome and was thankful to get away from the scene. We continued our slow progress for three whole days, after which we began to wonder whether we should ever reach our goal. Even the Rajah showed alight signs of impatience. At last, at sunset on the fourth day, on turning a sharp bend we saw a great steep rock sticking out of the bed of the river near the shore. Along the bank by the water stood a very long house on poles, covering the bank for about a quarter of a mile. Evidently the village of a very large tribe. It was to us a welcome sight. We had evidently arrived. Many canoes, large and small, were tied up to posts, but there was a deserted look along the banks and on the terrace of the house (or village). After some time we made out through our field-glasses a group of some fifty or sixty men emerging from the forest near by and making their way to the house. Splendid fellows they were, with spears and shields and warlike accoutrements. Their caps bristled with hornbill plumes, their hair looked as though glued down their backs, their ears, weighted down by leaden earrings, hung down to their shoulders, while the upper part was studded with tiger-cats teeth which looked like reversed horns. Some of their armlets were of ivory, and dozens of bangles covered their arms and legs. Their jackets were made of bide; their chawats twisted round their waists, taking the place of drawers. ended in a drapery front and back. Their sword sheaths were decorated with feathers and brass; they held spears in their hands. The whole effect was warlike, formidable and very picturesque. Roth my husband and Mr. de Crespigny were of the opinion that they had just returned from some head¬ hunting expedition in the neighbourhood. They paid no attention whatever to the steamer, but quietly passed it by and made their way up the forty-foot bamboo giving entrance to the house and disappeared inside. Silence followed. The river ran past us to the sea. Night was coming on, and there we were in a wilderness of wood and water— not a sound to be heard. "What do you think of it, de Crespigny?" said my husband at dinner. "I think, Rajah, there must be Brunei influence at work, and, with your permission, I will call on the Chief at the house to-morrow and inform him that you wish to see him on board.” The Rajah approved of this suggestion and Mr. de Crespigny was accordingly rowed ashore next morning. He was about to climb the pole to the house when three Kayans appeared at the top of it and waved to him to proceed no further. The three Kayans then came down the ladder, fully armed with spears and swords, and as they reached the ground Mr. de Crespigny took hold of each in turn and pushed him into the boat. They made no resistance and soon found themselves in the presence of the Rajah on the deck of the Sri Sarawak. They were fine-looking men, fairer and stouter than the Dyaks, all in full war¬ paint. and quiet and dignified in their greetings to the Rajah and myself when we touched the tips of each other’s fingers. The conversation, intrepreted by Mr. de Crespigny, was something like this, the Chief of the village being the spokesman. "Rajah Sarawak he very big man. Why he come here?" "I have come to pay you a visit," said the Rajah. "When can I go to your house?” "Oh, Rajah— very sad,” was the reply. "Rajah cannot come in just now. House is pemali” (under a curse). "No one from outside can come in for days.” “Then I will wait until days pass,” said the Rajah in a quiet and determined way. The Chief said nothing, but looked down and scratched himself. The Rajah then said, "Have you any strangers staying with you now?" The Chief looked uncomfortable and hen replied, "Yes, there are two Malays, sent from the Sultan, but they are pemali too. They are shut up—they must not leave the house.” "Very well,” said my husband. "Now you may go." The trio then took their departure after once more touching the tips of our fingers. They went down the com¬ panion, were rowed ashore in the boat, went up the bamboo ladder into the house and disappeared. "The Sultan of Brunei must have been told of my intended visit here," said the Rajah. "But here I remain until I get into the village and have a talk with the people.” What rather puzzled my husband and Mr. de Crespigny, however, was the fact of the inhabitants having resorted to the pemali, so that no strangers should be allowed to enter the walls of the house. I rather forget how many days we remained at anchor in the river below the long house at Batu Gading. It may have been three, or possibly four. Even the Kayans themselves, I imagine, were, aware that despite the two Brunei emissaries and their ruse of prolonging the pemali, nothing they could say or do would induce the Rajah to leave the district until his purpose—that of visiting the village—had been accomplished. Thus it happened that one morning the Rajah, tired of waiting, determined to send the pemali and all its measures to the devil. He ordered Mr. de Crespigny and my brother to land forthwith, make. their way up the pole to the house, and enter it with or without permission. Now it must be remembered that, in their heart of hearts, the Kayans knew the Rajah to be friendly to their tribe, and were only held back from welcom¬ ing him by the presence of the envoys from the Sultan of Brunei. I wish I could have seen the famous meeting! Mr. de Crespigny, urbane, digni¬ fied, very quiet in gesture and able to speak the Kayan language. My brother, young, lively, full of mischief and fun as he smiled and winked and showed signs of friendliness to the young Kayan warriors. My brother had a way with him which in all his journeys among the natives of Sarawak awakened friendly response in their hearts. It must have been apparent to the Kayans (themselves fully armed with spears and parangs) that they were in the presence of two brave men, for neither Mr. de Crespigny nor my brother had thought it necessary to protect themselves even with walking- sticks. "Now, you men of Batu Gading,” said Mr. de Crespigny, addressing the Chief and his followers and the two Pangerans, who hovered in the background. "The Rajah of Sarawak has come to pay you a friendly visit and, as you are aware, he is not accustomed to be kept waiting. Therefore, to-day, at the hour before the sun begins to set, his Ranee and himself intend to pay you a visit. He expects you—pemali or no—to be in readiness to receive him at that time." At the conclusion of this speech Mr. de Crespigny and my brother took their departure, escorted to the entrance of the house by the Chief and some of his men, descended the notched bamboo, and returned to the ship. They had not failed to note that their announcement of the Rajah's visit was received by the Sultan's Pan¬ gerans with evidences of the utmost discontent. As eight bells sounded from the deck of the Sri Sarawak that afternoon, the ship's boat, with crew reinforced by four of the Rajah's guard with loaded muskets, was awaiting us at the companion; my husband and I, accompanied by Mr. de Crespigny and my brother, got in and were rowed ashore. Lo and behold ! the landing-stage was filled with Kayan warriors, the Chief and his men ranged along the bank on either side of the climbing-pole. And how picturesque they did look, bristling with swords, spears, feathered caps, tigers' teeth; tattooed on legs and arms, be-bangled and hung with beads. I thought them beautiful and loved them all. As we stepped on shore the Rajah, with an impressive wave of the arm, ordered the boat, its entire crew, also the armed guard, back to the Sri Sarawak. "No guard whatever, Rajah?" inquired Mr. de Crespigny, as the boat receded from the shore. "A sign that we trust them absolutely,” said my hus¬ band, as the rifles were borne off on the stream. After they had saluted each other, the Chief led the way up the bamboo, followed by the Rajah. Then my turn came. Oh dear, another such a getting upstairs 1 Seeing my rueful expression, two beautiful young Kayan warriors came forward and offered me a hand. They were so graceful and charming I did my very best. They smiled sweetly at each effort I made to turn out my toes to the required position. They reminded me of Pan and other sylvan gods I had read about in fairy tales. When we reached the top each one deposited my hand back by my side with a courtly gesture. So many years gone by since then, and I can see them now! How I enjoyed it all, so strange, novel and fascinating was the scene I had been pushed into ! The Rajah, still escorted by the Chief and the most important members of the tribe, was the first to enter the long house {capable, said Mr. de Crespigny, of holding some, five hundred people). There was a platform in front, open to the air, and the verandah along which we were escorted was roofed-in the whole length of the house. As I followed my husband, Mr. de Crespigny and my brother on either side of me, I saw, all ranged against the wooden wall dividing the verandah from the dwelling-rooms beyond, Kayan warriors, spears in hand, standing straight and immovable. No one spoke. There was no sound but our footsteps as we were being led . . . where? At last we found ourselves in a large room the floor of which was covered with beautiful mats but having nn furniture of any kind except two large blocks of wood about three feet high, covered with some yellow cotton material. These were placed in readiness for the Rajah and myself to sit on, with our backs to the light. I was afterwards told by Mr. de Crespigny that the seat occupied by the Rajah was a huge slab cut out of the Tapang tree, those seats being heir-looms in Kayan families and descending, black with age, from fathers to sons for many generations. Mine was no doubt an afterthought of no great con¬ sequence. Mr. de Crespigny and my brother seated themselves on the floor. For a long time we all sat ou in silence, the only sounds to be heard being a cough or two now and then—the sort of coughs to be heard frequently at gatherings where constraint is felt and people are ill at ease. The behaviour of the two Pangcrans from Brunei was somewhat disconcerting. They kept prowling about among the Kayans, making signs to them and looking askance at us, until they finally wormed their way over to where we were and seated themselves on the floor behind us. Most uncomfortable ! I remember wondering if they intended jabbing us unprotected ones in the back with a kris! Admirable as usual on such occasions, my husband sat on, apparently as unconcerned as t hough he were seated on a chair in his study at home. He pulled his moustache, looked round at the assembly and then said, “I have come to see you all as a friend. I want to open up trade on tills river between my people and yours.” The Malay envoys hated it all, became restive and kept on chewing sirih, but the Chief and his followers were evidently pleased. The shy coughings ceased and gave place to contented wriggles of their bodies as they sat on the floor. After a little, the Chief rose to his feet and gave tongue. Being , ignorant to the Kayan language, the sounds he produced seemed to me like the croakings of a demented frog, but I was told that what he said was : "Rajah Sarawak, big man, friend of Kayans all over the country. Rajah wish make friends. We wish too!” "Baik!” (Good) replied my husband, and everyone, except the two emissaries of the Sultan, seemed to feel they were getting along very well. Smiles and greetings were exchanged, and a comfortable feeling came over us all. Then even poor me had a brain-wave! I turned to Mr. de Crespigny. "Ask the Chief where all the women are. I have come here with the Rajah, and as yet not one woman have I seen." "Not a had idea," said the Rajah. "Tell the Chief to send for the women.” A. young Kayan went off hurriedly, opened a door leading from the hall where we were sitting, went within and closed the door. Presently it was flung open, and a charming procession of females made their way into the hall, headed by the Chiefs wife, one of the most picturesque figures I have ever beheld. Small of stature, exquisitely formed, with a pale yellow complexion and large dark eyes of a somewhat Mongolian shape, the wonderful creature made her way slowly and with dignity to where we were sitting. Her black hair hung down over her shoulders and was bound round with a gleaming fillet of straw, her petticoat of white cotton was draped round her waist and reached her ankles, being slit up on one side to allow freedom of movement. At first I thought that her leg. which was revealed as she walked, was encased in dark blue velvet, but when she came nearer me I saw that what I bad taken to be velvet was a tattoo pattern covering her feet and legs. Behind her walked with equal dignity about thirty women, old and young. They appeared to me like Greek goddesses about to perform some sacred rite. The Chief’s wife came up to me, took possession of my hand which I placed in both of hers; we smiled at each other and it seemed as though mutual liking and trust were, at once established between us. I was wearing a thin sold chain on which hung a coral charm someone had once brought me from Naples. 1 pulled it off and slipped it over her head. More smiles, more messages of good-will flashed from each other’s eyes—those true indexes to innermost feel¬ ings. She sat on the floor at my feet, affectionately patting my knee with one hand while with the other she lovingly fondled the little charm I had hung round her neck. "A good idea of yours, Ranee,” said Mr. de Crespigny. The Rajah, too, seemed pleased, but of course he said nothing. I loved approbation, for I got so very little, and I felt important with a modest place in the picture. My brother was too much occupied on his own account to pay any attention to me. He was always at home in any company—civilized or no—and was then busily engaged with a young Kayan, a son of the Chief, inserting stilettos into each other’s arms and mixing their blood, thus proclaiming to all and sundry that they had become brothers and were cementing their new relationship in this manner. "Quite the right thing to do,” said Mr. de Crespigny, who, however, did not show the slightest eagerness to join in the scratchings by stilettos. When the Rajah gave the signal for us to depart , the women all escorted me to the entrance pole. The problem of descending was even worse than, that of ascending, but helped by my graceful Kayan cavaliers I accomplished it safely. The people all took leave of us with great affection, imploring us to come again, and we were rowed out to the Sri Sarawak, followed by the most vociferous farewells from the entire village gathered at the landing-stage. By that time the Brunei agents were no more to be seen ! “We must weigh anchor and move off at day¬ break,’’ said the Rajah, “or else the people will imagine that they must keep on sending us tokens of their goodwill and affection.” So, at the first streak of dawn, we steamed our way back down the Baram, all in the best of tempers. It was morning when we found ourselves at the mouth of the Baram. A capful of wind was blowing from the south-west and Mr. de Crespigny seemed rather perturbed about our chances of getting out to the Heartsease in such weather, hut the Rajah appeared quite calm. I sometimes think that my husband’s wonderful success as ruler, law-maker, civilizer and so forth may have been partly due to his never allowing “ifs” and “might be's” to interfere with his plans. On this particular occasion he was probably perfectly well aware, as a Naval man, that the vagaries of the strong wind might delay our boarding the yacht for a day, or even two or three days, but he never allowed anyone to assume that there was any anxiety in his mind on the subject. So we fussed and packed according to his orders. On arriving at the last reach of the river and coining into full view of the sea, the gale increased in force and great walls of white surf breaking on the shallow sandy shores threatened annihilation to any ship reckless enough to attempt to cross the bar. The Rajah, field-glass in hand, examined the position and ordered the anchor to be dropped. “Well, de Crespigny, we are stuck here for to-night,” he said, and relapsed into silence. Presently, from where I had gone to be ont of the wind, I heard the captain, the steward and, I think, the cook expressing their anxiety about the depleted state of the larder. They had provisioned the Sri Sarawak amply for the trip but had not reckoned on the extra days of waiting up at Batu Gading (owing to the pemali!), which had strained her resources, and we had had just enough to last us till that morning, by which time we had expected to be aboard the Heartsease. From what I could make out, there appeared to be nothing to fall back upon but dozens of tins of biscuits and dozens of pots of strawberry jam. On looking around us as we stood on deck, we had seen several wild cattle roaming about near the sandy shore of the river. The sight of these tawny creatures tilled two or three of our party on board with the happy idea of providing some solid meals while at the same time satisfying their sporting instincts. Rifles were pulled out, ammunition procured, and off the men set in a dinghy for the shore, watched with interest by Mr. de Crespigny and myself through our field¬ glasses, he expatiating on the satisfying meal which no doubt we should be enjoying before long. About half an hour after the hunters had disappeared round some green shrubs near the shore, we suddenly saw them emerge, running for their lives, pursued by an infuriated animal that looked like a great bull. The excitement was intense, and they just managed to reach the boat and push off in time, returning very much quicker than they had set out ! Poor dears, they looked very discomfited as they silently came on board. "Yes,” said the Rajah, “I thought that might happen; the cattle on these beaches are known to be savage and dangerous.” So there we were! For two whole days while we were waiting for the wind to die down, our meals consisted of biscuits and strawberry jam, eked out by smaller and smaller portions of white bread made from the last of the flour. The men consoled themselves with mild potations of beer and brandy-and-soda and I drank lea, of which we luckily still had plenty. Yet, through it all, good temper reigned supreme. Such silly jokes we indulged in ! I pinned up Mr. de Crespigny’s waistcoat with a safety-pin, which pin, he gallantly assured me, he would treasure for ever! We weighed each other on the weighing machine, pretending that we became lighter and lighter on the biscuits and jam diet. All very innocent, very silly, but such good fun ! When at last the storm died down and we reached the Heartsease to begin our journey back to Kuching, I, for one, felt sorry to think that our happy adventures had come to an end. Her Highness the Ranee’s Autobiography. We print below one of the many notices of Her Highness the Ranee’s autobiography which have recently appeared in the Press. It is taken from London Sunday Times:— SYLVIA OF SARAWAK : AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY. BY H.H. THE RANEE OF SARAWAK. (Hutchinson. 18s.) BY H. E. WORTHAM The Ranee of Sarawak begins by informing—or should I say warning?—us that this is not an ordinary autobiography. She keeps her word. It is not an ordinary autobiography. But one cannot accept her reason for being an autobiographer extra¬ ordinary, which is merely that she hates facts and fears dates. Facts indeed ! As if the whole auto¬ biographical tribe were not jesting Pilates in respect of this mere scaffolding of truth. And what need for dates has anyone who, like the Ranee, has mastered the art of being modem which, put less pretentiously, is conjugating the verb “to live” in the present tense? Besides, for all her chronological phobia, she sets her story in a framework of time. As an awkward girl she used to lake dancing lessons with Queen Victoria's grandchildren at Windsor Castle. The Queen herself, sho tells us, would watch the class, nodding encouragingly at their fancy steps, only to thump the floor furiously with her stick when little Prince Leopold of Battenburg failed to keep step in the final march past. The Ranee’s closing pages describe her “flight" from Sarawak, and the last photograph of her shows her being greeted at Croydon by her daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Hurry Roy. An epoch and a world lie between—a world uniting East and West, Sarawak and England. It is pictured in a pattern, vivid, highly coloured, sometimes garish. But whatever the tone it possesses the underlying unity of tem- persment and personality. It is this that places her autobiography apart from the normal examples of its kind. FATHER AND DAUGHTER For her present purpose the Ranee chose her father well. The daughter of the second Lord Esher, Sylvia Brett inherited her share of the talents which made that eminence grise of the Edwardian court one of the most charming and at the same time enigmatic figures of the period. Even his children felt something of this air of mystery which surrounded him. Our author, while submitting to the charm, experienced a measure of paternal severity which at times quenched filial affection in rebelliousness either overt or covert. If in consequence the Ranee's natural diffidence turned to an introspection which she described as morbid, it only banked down her native fire. As she grew up and fledged her wings she made her own friends among the “politicians, priests,, artists, and musicians"—(he list is hers, but it is by no means exhaustive—who were familiar visitors at her father’s house. Meanwhile she listened to their talk and learnt to observe—a faculty which serves her in this hook. How well the reader must judge. Whatever the distinction of her father, this young Edwardian had quite unusual qualities to lie able to command so many loyalties of friendship. After her marriage Mr. Bernard Shaw writes Ride a cock horse To Sarawak cross To see a young Ranee consumed with remorse. She'll have bells on her fingers And rings through her toes. And won’t be permitted to wear any clo'es, and then asks her to bring "the heathen potentate" to lunch. Sir James Barrie thought she would be "idolised at Sarawak." And another friend who says he will always love her dearly "in spite of your cruel criticisms," signs himself "J.F. (The King of Moods)." He was Sir John French—“an obstinate, foolhardy, lovable man whose memory will be for ever vivid and very near” is the Ranee's description of him whom of all her friends she knew best. "THIS RAJAH OF MINE" The hero of this autobiography—though 1 have heard it argued that to be modern an autobiography should have none—is the Rajah of Sarawak. Like her father, Sir Charles Vyner Brooke also appears as a man of mystery. But with it goes a boyish¬ ness, irrespressible, humorous, petulant, that is the cloak to the grave Englishman who labours for the good of his subjects. Here is her final summary :— Questions have been raised as to what kind of man this Rajah of mine is. I have tried to answer these questions through the pages of this intimate and detailed book—I have tried to con¬ vey what sort of a part my husband has played in this country, so remote and unexplored. I have tried to show that there are no poor, there are no unemployed, there is no cancerous growth that lies in the bosom of almost every country .... I have tried to explain the simple Brooke tradition. "Sarawak belongs to the Malays, sea and land Dayaks, Kayans, Kenyahs. Melanaus, Muruts, Kadayans. Bisa- yahs, and other tribes, and not to us. It is for them we labour, not ourselves.” No wife could pay her husband a finer tribute. Notes and Comments. "There is, however, a danger inherent in the very nature of Indirect Rule which needs con¬ sidering—the danger of making too much of a good thing, of making fetish instead of a stepping-stone (if I may mix my Metaphors) of existing native institutions. It can never be our aim, save perhaps with a few out-of-the-way peoples whose fate in unrestricted contact with Western ideas would be simply to wilt, degenerate and dis¬ appear ....................merely to preserve a human zoo, an Anthropological Garden. It cannot be our aim, for it would not work. Our mere presence in Africa makes it in the long run impossible; the fact that we are encouraging native production and native education, permitting the entry of white capital, missionaries, and science into Africa, makes it doubly impossible." These, remarks occur in Africa View, that admirable survey by Professor Julian Huxley of present-day social and political problems in Tropical Africa. The author is discussing the advantages and disadvantages of ‘Indirect Rule,' a system which, with certain safeguards and limitations, is in daily operation in the country; and it is at once apparent that his comments concern not only Africa, but also Sarawak. They apply with singular aptness to an attitude of mind which is all too prevalent to-day among those who come into dose contact with native races,—an attitude which will not admit that backward people have a right to their share of the benefits (such as they are) of the civilisation to which we have introduced them, and one which refuses to recognise the fact that primitive people are human beings who can no longer be treated as exhibits in a sort of zoo controlled by benevolent and understanding keepers. That the general public has until now been excluded to a great extent from these zoos, and that the exhibits have thereby been saved from the grosser manifestations of bad taste to which they might otherwise have been exposed does not alter the essential position, which is that they should not be in a zoo at all. The problem of the responsibility of civilized administrators towards the more primitive races under their charge is not one that can profitably be discussed in an hour or a day, least of all in a couple of columns of print, but we are at any rate on safe ground when we say that the trusteeship implied in that out-moded phrase 'The White Man's Burden' has in the past been all too often interpreted merely as a licence to exploit backward peoples without any thought of their rights and of their eventual place in the structure of humanity. Now, however, the wheel has turned full circle; it was started on its ponderous revolution by the realisation of just what was meant by certain methods of ‘civilising’ native tribes—‘Pax Belgica' in the Congo, for instance,—and the sudden swing of public opinion gave it such an impetus that there is now a real danger that it will turn too far. At the moment, unspoiled communities are at a premium ; wherever these are found the tendency is to put them into a sort of moral game reserve, to build a fence round them which will protect them, so to speak, from the vulgar attentions of the Bank Holiday crowd. This procedure, it is true, prevents them from being teased : but it also prevents them from escaping from the reserve should they wish to do so. and ensures for them a disastrous period of bewilderment and frustration when (as inevitably happens) the fence has to be taken down. There is, unfortunately, a type of European administrator who allows his sympathy for back¬ ward tribes and his enthusiasm for their institutions to run away with him, and to blind him to the real interests of the people he serves. It is the old story of choking the cat with cream; in the long run his unthinking solicitude and lack of foresight work just as much mischief as did the cruder methods of the earlier filibusters, and the people concerned have as little reason to be grate¬ ful to him as they had towards the advance guard of the old Imperialism. For he does not look upon them as adult human beings at all, but as children whom it is his duty to keep in a state of perpetual childhood; and although for the time ing all may appear well on the surface, this policy ensures all kinds of trouble in the years ahead, and so does the natives a real disservice. This is what Professor Huxley has to say on this subject:— "Let me take a parallel from family life. There are plenty of parents who treat their children as pets. .They find them delightful so long as they remain childish playthings which have the unique advantage of being alive and able to talk. But they have forgotten that the little darlings are real human beings like their elders and betters; and when the children grow up, show signs of thinking for themselves, and demand to be dealt with on the adult plane—why. then there is trouble. The trouble comes from two sides at once. For one thing, the parents want to keep their pets as long as possible, and unconsciously resent any move in the direction of indepen¬ dence ; and for another, the boys and girls are, of course, very young and inexperienced, they do make mistakes, they are crude and callow and unbalanced, and irritate both by their awkward diffidence and their unteachable obstinacy. "But the children will grow up—that is how they are made, that is why they were brought into the world, and it is doubtless very irrational of parents to feel aggrieved at it. But aggrieved they often feel, and will do so unless they discount the change beforehand with the aid of a little reason and a little imagination. "It is much the same with the contact between a high civilisation and the more pri¬ mitive peoples under its charge. As long as natives can be treated as children, aggravating and yet charming creatures who must just be told what to do and what not to do, and attempts at argument can be cut short by some authoritative gesture, they will inevitably be popular with their white guardians. But when they begin to develop and tn demand a share in the. same world of thought and life in which we white people live, matters are different. The black children are growing up. They are no longer children. But the adoles¬ cence of a people is more prolonged and more difficult than the adolescence of an individual; its half-bakedncss and crudity will be more pronounced. And an adolescent people is bound often to irritate those who have stood in loco parentis to it. and set their teeth on edge. "It is indeed remarkable to see how wide¬ spread (though by no means universal) and deep-rooted (though often unconscious) is the feeling of white men against the Europeanized, educated, or even progressive native. And the feeling is often strongest in those who have a whole-hearted liking for the unsophisticated native. It is remarkable, because, after all, the white man's very existence in the country involves change and introduces new standards; the assumption underlying government of black by white is that white ideas and methods are superior to black; and the aim of the control and the education we thrust upon them is to give them Western ideas, skill, and individual self-reliance, and, in the case of mission education, Western religious beliefs and ideals as well. Yet if they really begin to put these ideas into practice and try to live up to the new standards, the first reaction of Europe, in the persons of the local Europeans, is hostile. "Europe cannot have it both ways. If wo rule by virtue of some white superiority, we must expect the natives to take our ideas and methods as worthy of imitation; if we educate them to think for themselves about their agriculture and their trades and their local administration, we must remember that the different parts and activities of mind are by no means thought-tight, and must expect them to use their brains on other and more general topics; when you have encouraged the child to grow up, you must not expect him to remain a child." Every word in the last two paragraphs should be underlined with the heaviest red pencil procurable, for red is the traditional colour of danger signals, and even the most superficial survey of present-day conditions in Sarawak will convince all who have eyes to see that those signals, or something very like them, are flying in Sarawak at this moment, and that if we choose to ignore them, we shall do so at the risk of laying up serious trouble for ourselves in the years ahead. The extract we have quoted gives the opinion of an expert who combines an admirably-balanced judgment with one of the most penetrating intellects of our times. In view of this, it is probable that even the most obstinate supporters of the ‘human zoo’ policy will concede I that there is something in what he says; and anyone who cares to devote a little thought to the question will realise that there is a very great deal in it indeed. At the present moment, Sarawak stands at the cross roads. For better or worse, conditions have changed and are rapidly changing, and the 'zoo' idea is now an anachronism which can no longer he tolerated if the natives are to get the square deal to which they are entitled. Sarawak has ceased to be an oasis of peace in an age of hustling materialism; no longer can it be regarded as a kind of sanctuary where natives can live a life of idyllic simplicity untroubled by echoes from the outside world. To take only one instance, if it is a commonplace to say that the aeroplane has abolished distance, it is none the less true. Although the development of air communications in the Far Fast is still in its infancy, it is making great strides even now, and is opening up prospects that in their different way are just as dazzling as those which followed the first voyages of discovery in the Orient. By abolishing distance, the aeroplane has cut sharp across the various strata of contemporary civili¬ sation and has thereby accelerated immeasurably the process of adjustment that is always going on between one level of culture and another. The results of this process no one as yet can foresee; we can only say with safety that in a very short time, as these things go, there will no longer be any such thing as genuine isolation. It is our duty to face this fact, and to endeavour to fit the natives for the struggle that lies before them,—the struggle to adapt themselves to the new world which is being opened up to them. It may be a long time before the impact of what we call ‘civilization’ becomes a serious problem, but that is no reason why we should not start now to prepare for the future. If one discusses Professor Huxley’s views in the light of their application to Sarawak, it may be argued that they do not apply to all. since we are not ‘encouraging the child to grow up'. In reply we can put the old. unanswerable question : if not. why not? What are we here for? What account of our stewardship will our successors be able to render in fifty, a hundred years' time? If our main object is not to promote the welfare of the people and improve their condition generally, what excuse is there for our continued presence in their country? If we admit this, as surely we must, we must also admit that what we are trying to do means ‘progress', and that whether we like it or not. in the long run 'progress' inevitably means ‘civilisation’. The solution of the problem—that of the gradual adaptation of primitive natives to modern civili- sation—lies in the one word ‘education.’ Some years ago this Gazette expressed high hopes of the educational policy that was then being started with the construction of Maderasah Melayu, Kuching’s Malay College; unfortunately the depression inter¬ vened. and those hopes were not fulfilled. It is a regrettable, if perhaps an inevitable, fact that during the past few’ years Sarawak's educational policy has been one of drift. This, though admit¬ tedly due in a large measure to financial difficulties, is simply not good enough, for it is growing more and more apparent that education—the right sort of education, that is.—is not a luxury but a vital necessity. No one in his senses wishes to produce a class of 'failed B.A’s’, and Sarawak’s educational policy must be shaped to avoid the mistakes that have been made in India and other Eastern countries. But if we are to fulfil our duty to the people of the State we must put our educational house in order, and without further delay. It is gratifying to note that there are indications that the dangers of the ‘drift’ policy are fully realised, and that this most important question is now to receive the attention which it deserves. The Borneo Company, Limited. 143RD ORDINARY GENERAL MEETING. The One Hundred and Forty-third Ordinary General Meeting of the Company was held on the 11th October, 1936, at the Registered Offices of the Company, 143-149, Fenchurch Street, London. E.C. 3. Sir Adam B. Ritchie (Chairman of the Company) presided. The notice convening the meeting and the Auditors’ Report having been read by the Secretary, the Minutes of the previous Annual General Meeting, and also the Directors’ Report and Accounts were taken as read. The Chairman then apologised for the absence through illness of Mr. H. A. Trotter, one of the Directors, and proceeded :— The past year has proved one of varying fortunes, in which our hopes in some directions have been more than realised, and in others have ended in dis¬ appointment. Reviewing our operations generally, there was during the past financial year a distinct improvement, in spite of the continuance of the disadvantages resulting from exchange difficulties, import duties, quotas, prohibitions, and all the other restrictions which are so strangling to the interchange of trade between different countries. The recent International Agreement on exchange rates for the principal currencies in the world will be of immediate benefit to our Haboko Tea Company in Sumatra, and if. as I hope, this Gentlemen’s Agreement proves to bo a prelude to the pruning down of these restrictions which I have just referred to. the improvement which will result in International trade must be reflected in our business. It is early yet, however, to be able to gauge the extent of this improvement, which can only be gradual. From the printed copy of the Profit and Loes Account before you, it will be seen that the profit for the year was .4*9.222. 18s. 4d.—an increase of £4,611. 17s. 10d. over the previous year. The improvement in our business which 1 have referred to is not confined to this small increase in profits as these have been arrived at after making an exceptional charge for depreciation of our tea and rubber estates of £25,768. 13s. 10d., as against .£7,594. 3s. 8d. in the previous year. I will explain the reasons for this increase shortly. Again, the amount taken from the special Teak Reserve to meet losses on teak trading is £16,469. 10s. less than it was in the previous year. The improvement in our business, therefore, is more marked than would appear from the figures of profits which are shown. To pass now to the particular departments of our business. In teak, which, as you are aware, has dominated our fortunes in the recent past, there was during last year a very appreciable improve¬ ment. both in offtake and in prices, which, however, was more noticeable in those markets giving preference to timber of British origin. Tn the markets where we now have to look for the bulk of our offtake, prices have not risen correspondingly. I refer particularly to China, where business continues to be depressed in consequence of political uncertainties and exchange difficulties, and which, so far as teak is concerned, has become little more than a dumping ground for inferior qualities. It is interesting to compare some figures of the exports of teak from Siam in 1931 and last. year. The volume of exports to India and to the United Kingdom, which are now largely closed to us through Imperial Preference, fell by 44.4 per cent. and 62.12 per cent., and prices by 14.8 per cent, and 32 per cent, respectively. Similarly exports to China fell by 50.5 per cent, and prices by 20 per cent. Such figures clearly indicate the difficulties which the teak industry in Siam has had to face during the past few years. In order to offset the unsatisfactory state of these markets, we are endeavouring to extend our connections in other territories which still remain open to us. and we are meeting with some success, although competition is very keen. When I addressed yon last, year, I expressed the hope that, with the help of certain economies in our costs of extraction of teak from the forests, we should be able to avoid another loss this year. Our extraction costs were actually reduced by about 10 per cent., but this proved insufficient to counterbalance the low prices persisting in several of our markets, and accordingly our operations resulted in the loss of £12,929. 3s. 4d., which compares with the loss of £29,398. 13s. 4d. in our accounts for the previous year. During the last few months we have installed new and more up-to-date machinery for converting the timber in our saw mill in Bangkok with a view to increasing our output of timber and reducing costs. We shall, therefore, during the latter part of the current year secure the benefit of a further reduction in costs, but I cannot say yet whether or not the returns we may obtain for our timber will result in a profit. All I can say with certainty is that demand and prices are being maintained, and that we are now down to rock- bottom in the matter of costs. Unfortunately 1 can give you no further inform- ' ation as to what is going to happen after the expiry of our existing forest leases in four years' time, as we are still waiting to learn what the policy of the Siamese Government is to be. The delay in this intimation by the authorities is causing ourselves and other producers no little inconvenience at present. Our tea gardens in Sumatra, operating under the name of the Haboko Tea Company, Limited, exported the full quantity allowed under the Res¬ triction Scheme, although climatic conditions were less favourable than during the previous year. Cost of production remained steady, but selling prices were lower than during 1934-1935. Since the end of our financial year there has been a considerable improvement in prices which I have hope may be maintained, and now that we have a more favourable exchange rate for the guilder anticipate that, excluding the present heavy charges for depreciation of buildings and plant, we shall secure a profit from our tea in the current year. The area of the estale under rubber is developing satisfactorily, and the tapping tests which were continued during the year proved encouraging. The erection of a factory capable of handling the production of rubber within the limits prescribed by the Restriction Scheme was completed during the year, and manufacture commenced early in May last. The danger of lalang grass spreading over the estate has been successfully overcome, and the reports of our local Managers and Visiting Agents show the cultivation of the Estate to be in capable hands. Whilst no sales of rubber were made last year, we were, able to dispose of our quota rights under the Restriction Scheme at substantial prices. The revenue which we received from this source has been utilised to write down the values of the original buildings, for which no depreciation has been provided in the past. This is the explanation of the exceptional figure for depreciation which is noted in the Profit and Loss Account. 1 look forward to the time when the rubber estate will prove to be one of the most important sources of income for our Company. Turning now to the merchandise side of our business, this continues to expand, especially in Malaya and Sarawak, in both of which countries we made profits. In Siam where, as I told you last year after my visit to that country, there are not the same opportunities for expansion, we are conducting a moderate business out of which the revenue is proportionately small. Our shipping and produce businesses in Siam both resulted in a loss last year. In consequence of competition in freights by tramp steamers, and of the very large reduction in the quantities of timber now being shipped from Siam to India, we have decided to close down our business as charterers between Siam and India, which we have successfully carried on for a period of 40 to 50 years. Our produce business, which is mainly in rice, suffered losses which were common to all shippers last year in consequence of intense competition in a limited market. Rice is a commo¬ dity which is becoming more and more speculative to handle, but in which there are still opportunities for making good profits, provided that the restrictions in foreign countries against Siamese rice are not increased. Our subsidiary companies in Malaya, Alexandra Brickworks. Limited, and Borneo Motors, Limited, both experienced better years, especially the latter, which was able to pay a dividend of 12} per cent. hope that it may be possible for this Company to continue to pay substantial dividends to us, but I doubt whether its earnings can be maintained on so high a scale as last year. The Alexandra Brickworks made a small profit, but not sufficient to enable resumption of the payment of dividends on its Preference capital, which are now four years in arrears. During the current year there has been a considerable increase both in the offtake and in the prices of the Company’s products and in time I have little doubt that we shall again earn some revenue from this investment. Turning to the balance sheet for a minute, there are only one or two comments which I have to make. There is a small increase in the amount of the Reserve Account, resulting from the recovery of a sum set aside some years ago to meet a contingent loss. The withdrawals from the Reserve Account represent the amounts taken for bad and doubtful debt provision and for depreciation of stocks of merchandise. Amounts due by the Company, including bank overdrafts, show a considerable increase, reflecting the expansion in our merchandise and produce businesses, and corres¬ ponding to increases in amounts due to the Company and stock of produce on the assets side. There are no other points I need draw your attention to, hut. if any shareholder would like additional information about any of the items. I shall be pleased to give it at the close of my remarks. On behalf of my Board, I must again express to you our regret that it has been impossible to recommend any dividend for the Preference Share¬ holders. The Preference dividend is now in arrears for four years, and under the Reconstruction Scheme, which, as mentioned in our Report, will shortly be placed before you, provision will be made for dealing with those arrears. I had hoped to be able to present this scheme to you now, so that it could be considered in conjuction with the Accounts which are before you, but unfortunately it could not be completed in time to permit of all the prelimi- nary procedure which is necessary in the formulation of such a scheme. It must be apparent to everyone that the earning power of those assets on which we were previously accustomed to rely for so large a proportion of our revenue has been seriously reduced owing to the changed conditions for the particular businesses in which we are interested. The outlook is certainly brighter than it has been for some time, but even so, your Board can see no probability of the Company, constituted as it is at present, earning sufficient revenue to pay the Preference dividends and at the same time provide something in the shape of dividends for the Ordinary Shareholders. We consider, therefore, that the time has come when we should put forward a scheme of such a nature that the Company may got rid of its out- standing arrears of Preference dividend and be placed in a position to resume payment of dividends ! on the reduced amount of its capital. It. is difficult to calculate for the future in a business comprising so many varied interests, such as ours. I must take some risk, however, and I do not think that I am taking an undue risk in estimating that, provided the scheme is adopted, the future earnings of the Company will he sufficient to permit of the payment of moderate dividends. Lastly, it remains for me to commend to you j the loyal work of your Managers and Staff, both here in London and in the East, who one and all are striving to improve the fortunes of your Company. I may say that during the past year your Board had much satisfaction in being able to remove the special cut in all staff salaries, which had remained in force for a period of four years and which has now been abolished, with the exception of the remuneration of the members of your Board. It is always a pleasure to me to have this opportunity of expressing to you the Appreciation of your Board of the work which your staff is doing, and if anyone present would care to add a few words on behalf of the Shareholders I shall have much pleasure in passing on his remarks. After moving the adoption of the Report and Accounts, which was seconded by Mr. A. A. Jamieson, the Chairman invited questions from Members present. Most of them related to the proposed Reconstruction Scheme, but the Chairman pointed out that it was impossible to give any details of the scheme at this meeting, and said that ample opportunity would be given for discussion of the scheme by all Shareholders after it had been placed before them. The Report and Accounts, as submitted, were unanimously adopted, and the retiring Directors, Messrs. A. Whitworth and H. A. Trotter, were re-elected. Messrs. Turquand, Youngs & Co., the Auditors of the Company, were re-appointed for the current year. Mr. R. S. Robertson then said : Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, for several years past we have had to possess our souls in patience, hut if I have interpreled the remarks of the Chairman correctly, our patience is at last to be rewarded, as there are better prospects for the future. We do not, of course, know yet what will be the nature of the proposals which will shortly be presented to us, but for the circumstances which have made the reconstruction necessary our staff are in no way responsible, and in the meantime I are sure you will all join with me in thanking our Managers and staff at horne and abroad for having successfully brought our Company through the difficulties of the past few years. In seconding, Mr. W. J. Webster said that to their thanks he wished to add their congratulations to the Managers and staff. After thanking Messrs. Robertson and Webster for their kind remarks, which he said would be very gratifying to the staff, the Chairman then declared the meeting closed. Mr. Salter then proposed a hearty vote of thanks to the Chairman and expressed the confidence of the Shareholders in the Board. The proceedings then terminated. AGRICULTURE. INTERESTING EXPERIMENT WITH SARAWAK PINEAPPLES. The following is an extract, from a report by Mr. G. St. F. Dare, Senior Agricultural Officer, Sarawak :— “A trial shipment of thirty Sarawak pines was made to the Government Canning Officer, at Kuala Lumpur. The pines were picked and plucked and were despatched to Kuala Lumpur on August 15th. The Canning Officer reported that they arrived in excellent condition, and were canned on August 19th and 20th; his report appears below, and from his remarks it would appear that canning Sarawak pines is a commercial proposition, although in mv opinion more care in plucking and handling would be necessary than in the case of the smaller variety now canned in Johore. Further trials will be carried out by this Department.” Report on canning trials carried out by the Department of Agriculture, S.S and F.M.S. Kuala Lumpur, on samples of Sarawak pineapples sent over by the Senior Agricultural Officer Sarawak, on August 17th, 1936. Be suits.—Thirty Sarawak pineapples were picked on August 14th, 1936, in Kuching, and sent to the Department of Agriculture, Kuala Lumpur, where they were canned on August 19th and 20th. The pines were carefully packed complete with crown suckers and arrived in excellent condition. The weights of the individual fruits with crown suckers removed varried from 6.7. to 10.2 lbs., the average weight of a single fruit being 8.25 lbs. From a total weight of fresh fruit, less crown suckers, of 248 lbs. 94 cans of cubes, segments and juice were packed, the cans used being the 1 1/2 lb. tall size and consisted of the following - This represents a total recovery of cut fruit and juice of 41 per cent, of the fresh fruit, which is about 10 per cent, greater than the average recovery obtained from Singapore canning pines, owing to the greater size of the Sarawak pines. Tt must be remembered that this figure was taken over thirty “selected” pine and may not be a true representative of the recoverable fruit. The fruit was prepared for canning in the way usually employed in Malaya, that is, it was peeled and cut by hand, washed and filled into the cans. Owing to the size of the cores of the pines it was impossible to cut the fruit into slices, the cores being two inches and more in diameter, also the fruits were so large that in order to cut slices to fill the standard sizes of cans, the waste would have been prohibitive, so in order to get over this difficulty some of the pines were cut into segments and the rest into cubes. In this way a minimum j of waste was obtained. The cut fruits were divided up into batches of ten cans each and each hatch was given a different treatment, in order to find out which process was the most suitable, for this variety of pineapple. The actual processes are described on the table attached to each can, each batch being given a serial number from 10 to 18. The following are the results of examination after the cans had been incubated for three weeks :— No. 10.—Vacuum 10 -12 inches of mer¬ cury. Hydrometer reading of syrup 16c BRIX (i.e., 16% by weight of sugar) : very pale yellow colour and white patches : syrup clear and flavour quite good. Not cooked enough. This pack would be equivalent to the Malaya “Good Average Quality” grade. (There are three grades in Malaya, namely “Golden." “Good Average Quality” and “Second.”) No. 11.—Vacuum 14—16" Hg. 16° Brix syrup. Bale yellow colour with few white patches: clear syrup. Flavour good. A little more cooking needed. No. 12.—Vacuum 15" Gh. Syrup 16° Brix. Straw yellow colour, no white, patches, fair flavour. Would pass as ‘G.A.Q.’ No. 13.—Vacuum 10" Hg. Syrup 18° Brix. Fair golden colour a little white; good appearance and flavour. This pack would definitely be classed as “Golden” grade. No. 11 —Vacuum 6.5" Hg. Appearance good but rather stale cooked flavour. Not good. The wrong process was used. No. 75.—Vacuum 7* Hg. Cooked stale flavour and too sweet. Pale colour. (Total acidity of juice, estimated at citric acid = .802%. Malayan pines have acidity .5-.6%. With both the juices the wrong process was used; since canning these I have worked out a process which retains the natural flavours better and I propose to try again with some locally procured Sarawak pines.) No. 16.—Vacuum 16" Hg. Syrup 22° Brix. Very good appearance no white; good flavour, good golden colour. This seems to be a very suitable process for this variety. This pack would beat most Malayan packs for quality. No. 17,—Vacuum 13" Hg. Syrup 25° Brix. Washed out appearance, dull flavour : obviously an unsuitable process. No. 18.—Vacuum 15" Hg. Syrup 25° Brix. Good colour; some white. Good flavour, would pass as "Golden.” CONCLUSIONS. From these results it is quite apparent that Sarawak pineapples can be canned successfully, but that they require very much more care in handling and processing than the Malayan pines. Batches No. 13 and 16 both indicate that a steam exhaust of from 6—10 minutes coupled with about 12 minutes cooking at 20 lbs. per square inch steam pressure (259oF) is a suitable process and that canned pineapple can be produced of a standard equal to the best quality by this method. As the flesh of Sarawak pineapples is naturally white, greater care would have to be taken to see that the fruit was just ripe when it was picked : unripe Sarawak pines will never attain the golden yellow colour which is considered desirable in canned pine¬ apple. The flesh of a ripe Sarawak pineapple although comparatively white when fresh, will turn a good golden colour when canned, using a suit¬ able process; unripe pine remains perfectly white. The percentage recovery of cut fruit appears to be appreciably higher than for the Malayan pines on account of the large size of the Sarawak pines; for the same reason the cutting expenses would he considerably reduced. A cutter would probably be able to cut 50 per cent, more cut fruit per hour than with the smaller pines. It is impossible to cut slices from pines of this size but the yield in cubes and segments is high. Segments have been packed by Hawaiian canneries as a fancy pack, but there seems no reason why this should not become one of the popular packs. The Sarawak pine when canned has a very plea¬ sant flavour closely resembling the flavour of the Smooth Cayenne variety which is canned in Hawaii. The flavour is altogether stronger than the Malayan pines, and I think much more palatable. The Sarawak pines seem to be admirably suit¬ able for the preparation of juice; the yield of juice from the waste is very high and owing to the high acidity, about 50 per cent, higher than Malayan pineapple juice, the flavour is excellent, it now remains to find a process to retain this good flavour as it is in its fresh condition. The necessary can¬ ning plant for handling 60 cans per minute, or working a 16 hour day during the rush season to turn out 1,200 cases per day of 48 cans each would cost approximately $12,000 exclusive of the build¬ ing : some of this machinery could be obtained locally at much less cost, but the main items such as the exhauster, cooker and cooler would have to be bought from England. I feel quite sure that, if someone were to start up a factory on the right lines for canning Sarawak pines and grew his own pines too, it would be successful; with care a pack superior to the Malayan certainly in flavour and perhaps quality could be produced for which there would be a ready market if the price could be kept on the level of the Malayan canned pines. Dayak Myths and Legends. It is a long time now since I first began to realize how rich in myth and legend the Dayak language is. These myths are of an interest which a casual acquaintance with the people would not lead one to suspect, and of course, to the sceptical European may even bo found amusing. From that time, I have felt an increasing regret that no one has made a proper study of this lore. It may be that apart from the time necessary to devote to it, the position of the Government Officer as the ruler, expounder of the law, and distributer of chastisement is not one to give that personal intimacy with the people, and that sympathy with their domestic joys and sorrows, hopes and mis- givings, which are so essential in the mythological student in order to draw from the people those folk stories of which they are half proud and half , ashamed, and about which they are at the same time both derisive and fearful. While I hesitate to venture upon so broad a field of study with my comparatively short experience, I none the less feel that as long as nothing is put on record, none is likely to appear, and on that ground alone I venture to offer the following in the hope that those many others who have heard, and probably better understood, other myths and legends, will also contribute. In doing so they may rest assured t hat they are helping to a better under¬ standing of a unique and progressive people and at the same time working in the cause of science. Legend I.—The Spirit of the Mountains. Manv many generations ago, when the great river still flowed through the Dutch lakes down the Undup and Batang Lupar to join the great river of China, the whole of Nimong mountain belonged to a powerful person named Batang Anyut. He was more than a mortal, being on his mothers' side descended from the Spirits. He was possessed of a famous sword named Bang, and the fame of his exploits with this sword were spoken of in the Courts of the Emperors of China, and such was his prowess that three long houses, each bigger than all the houses in .Stumbin put together cud to end, would hardly hold the heads he had taken in fair fight (for never once was he known to strike his man without giving his war whoop at the same time, and one stroke was always enough). His temper was fiery, and shorter than that of a wounded boar at bay, and this, combined with his sword Ilang and his skill in ambush, explains his wealth in heads. With him, on the hill, lived his sister Uteh, a specialist in sewing, with her two sons. There were no others in the whole country side. When the two sons were of sufficient age. their uncle Anyut decided to share out the hill Nimong, a piece for him and a piece each for the two sons, who in return would have to support their mother, as he was now getting too old to supply her with the needles she desired. You may, of course, be sure that he retained a large part of the hill for himself. All went well for a short time, but then one of the sons noticed that his padi was being eaten each night. The matter became so serious that he decided at last to sit up all night and catch the intruder. After many hesitations, he chose a night, unfor¬ tunately for him a moonless one, and went up the hill to keep his vigil. Very soon, before he had had time to get properly asleep, he heard rustlings, loud ones as of a great beast in the distance, but rapidly approaching. His loneliness, the darkness, and the approach of the unknown foe, rooted him to the ground, powerless to flee. Suddenly, on a crescendo of fury of crashing branches and splitting trunks, there reared up before him a fearsome grasi (evil spirit), tall as the highest trees, broad as a river, distorted and humpbacked, his eyes as big as two moons, and glittering with a pale green light. At last the limbs of the terrified mortal found their power to function, and with a scream of horror he fled down the hillside with the ghastly laughter of the spirit piercing his eardrums, and the fumes of its breath scorching the hair on the back of his head. (This is why the Nimong people now wear their hair cut short.) In the end he rushed into bis house and straight into his room, where he immediately fainted, and did not move for three days. When he awoke, it was to an ague of trembling so acute that the beating of his hee's on the ground created an earth¬ quake. It was this earthquake that Bukit Sadok first appeared and divided the great river into the valleys that have now dwindled to the Batang Lupar and the Rejang. After many months his full faculties returned to him, and he began to wonder how he was to continue his farming with such a monster abroad on his land. So he decided to go to China, where in those days lived many men learned in the arts of dealing with spirits. He went with some mis¬ giving for he doubted if any man could effectively deal with so terrible a spirit. However, after many wanderings he came upon an old man who said that he himself had had contact with even such a spirit and knew of a method of moving him along, and gave him a powerful charm which he called ubat chit to spread all over his farm. Unfortunately, when he said “moving him along" he was speaking literally, for all that his charm did was to move the evil spirit along on to his brother's farm. The brother, being aware of the first son’s experience, decided immediately to visit the same learned man and see if he could get rid of his unwelcome visitor. So taking a pile of heads from his uncle's store (the only currency they had, in those days) he also went off to China and procured some of the famous charm. Once again the awful spirit moved on, but this time he had nowhere to go but to the uncle's land. The uncle not being aware of what had been going on in his sister's and nephew’s house was at a loss to account for the damage to his padi. However, after some deliberation he came to the following conclusion. His nephews, having been given a share of his land were now getting rapacious, and wanted the whole lot. He decided therefore to end the trouble in his characteristic fashion, by taking his sword Hang to them. Crimson with rage, he tore along the path for his revenge, but luckily met bis sister, who seeing him on evil bent so close to home, reproved him for making noises after hours, and made him calm down a bit. She, being of the same descent as Uncle himself, also knew a thing or two, and had some power over him. When he had so far recovered himself as to be fool enough to argue with a woman, he explained about the losses in his farm, giving full details, with a meaty appendix on overhead coats. Then of course his sister was able to explain the business of the wicked spirit, and how her sons had pot rid of it. This made Uncle take another dive or friend Hang, and redouble his threats against the hapless nephews. However, Uteh had a wrinkle or two up her sleeve, and breathing half a dozen spells, sho fetched Uncle a smack on the back of the head with a log of wood which happened to be lying about, and laid him out. When he came to she said now would he listen to reason or would he like another chip off the same block. (Alack that hands that had threaded so many a fine needle should be forced to such bloodsomc methods at the crossroads !) However, she must have wielded a pretty log of wood, for Uncle, though not in the mood for reason¬ ing at all, did not want any more chips off that or any other block. He would rather keep what he still had. In the end then, Uncle was packed off to China to see if he could raise a better brand of charmer than that which they had had so far. He went breathing many unquotable vengeances against nephews who spent their time between flips to China in dumping illicit spirits on other people’s land and pinching people's heads when they weren’t ! looking. Still, taken all round, it was lucky that he went, for the advice which he got was good, so good that it is used by all Dayaks to the present day. And the good advice was this,—they must first make sure that the evil spirit was on the mountain (how, was not mentioned,) then fell a belt of jungle all round the mountain, for it was felt that the spirit was sure to be a jungle dweller and would not cross the cleared land. Having connected the belt all round the hill, all they had to do was to continue the felling upwards and drive the evil one up to the top. They must never fell the jungle right on the top, or he would have nowhere to retreat, and the whole tribe of spirits would visit their wrath on them, which would be no fun nt all. They must also be careful not to make the remain¬ ing topnotch of jungle too small, or maybe the spirit would be annoyed and occasionally come down and visit his annoyance on them. This was done, and the scheme was a success. That is why you will always sec that the Dayaks never fell all the jungle on a hill on which there is a spirit, and always leave his jungle sanctuary right on the top. Furthermore, you will find that the only people who see this particular kind of evil spirit are those who have felled too near the top, and who have therefore forced the spirit into quarters that are too cramped for him. On Nimong itself, the origin of the scheme and the site of the first experiment, the spirit settled down and made himself a lake on top for his drinking water, and the sign by which we know that the lake was the work of the spirit is that though it is surrounded by trees, no leaf has yet fallen upon it or into it. It is of interest that this lake was still in existence five years ago, to my own personal knowledge. Unfortunately, about that time ago, some extra felling was done near the top of the hill and must have greatly displeased the spirit, for one day the lake suddenly sank into the ground and has never since been seen. Also, that very day one of the men who did the felling slipped on the mountain and fell to his death, and of the people who were concerned in that felling, not a single one is left to-day to tell of it. —B.

Minutes of a General Meeting of the Race Course Development Fund held at the Court House, Kuching, on Sunday, November 22nd, at 9.30 a.m. The Chairman of the Collection Committee opened the proceedings by saying that the receipts to date amounted to a little over $11,000 which was not sufficient to justify a start being made on developing the area. Dr. Wong Cheong Way said that a large number of the public did not understand the objects of the Fund, and asked what would be Government’s attitude if the Fund could be increased to $20,000 by further subscriptions, and suggested a Gymkhana Meeting at the race-course. He suggested that if such a Meeting were held for one or two days at Chinese New Year and all proceeds, including proceeds of sweepstakes, were to go to the Fund, some $5,000 or $6,000 could be raised. Mr. Calvert agreed that the name was unfortunate and probably caused misunderstandings regarding the objects of the Fund, and suggested a change of name. Mr. Le Gros Clark suggested changing the name of the Fund to "Centenary Fund." Mr. Boyd suggested "Jubilee Fund." The Chairman said that he agreed with a change of name but this should be decided after a decision had been arrived at with regard to the future of the Fund. Mr. Le Gros Clark asked bow the figure of $50,000. which was the sum originally asked for,' was arrived at. The Chairman said that this figure was quite arbitrary. Mr. Le Gros Clark suggested that the cost of the scheme should be worked out before proceeding further with the scheme. The Chairman said that there was no one to do this, besides which there never was any intention of doing all development at once. Mr. Le Gros-Clark asked whether the original figure of $50,000 made allowance for upkeep, and the Chairman replied that, it was intended that a certain amount of the money collected should be put aside, and the interest used for purposes of upkeep. Mr. Le Gros Clark then put a motion to the Meeting that the scheme be abandoned and contri¬ butions refunded: this was put to the Meeting and rejected unanimously. - . Dr. Wong s suggestion of a Gymkhana Meeting was put forward and carried unanimously, and it was agreed that the Turf Club he asked whether they would support a Gymkhana Meeting in February. Mr. Pegler suggested that development be started now. The Chairman pointed out that the money available was insufficient and in any case in view of the possibility of getting Chan Kui Seng's land development should be deferred as the hill on Chan Kui Seng’s land would reduce any costs of filling very appreciably. The Datu Bandar said that in any case develop¬ ment should wait until the fine weather. Mr. Calvert's suggestion that the name of the Fund be changed was then put to the Meeting and passed unanimously. Abang Daim seconded Mr. Boyd's proposal to change the name to "Jubilee Fund”—No votes. Mr. Calvert suggested "Jubilee Recreation Ground." Datu Bandar seconded. This was passed unanimously. Dr. Wong Cheong Way suggested that as the objects included the making of football fields which could be used by schools in Kuching, the boys of all schools be asked to contribute even very small sums so that they would feel now and in later years that they had done something towards the ground and therefore had a personal interest in its success. The Chairman pointed out that while he agreed with the suggestion in principle, he considered that such a course would not be justified unless there was some guarantee that at least one football field would be constructed. Mr. Ong Kwan Hin seconded Dr. Wong Cheong Way’s suggestion ; this was defeated as no one voted. Mr. Shimizu suggested that funds might be raised by public lottery ; this was seconded by Mr. Pollard and passed by 26 votes to 23. There being no further business, the Meeting closed.

At the end of the year it is customary for cinema critics to indulge in the singularly profitless but rather amusing occupation of cataloguing the best films that have appeared during the past twelve months. For weeks afterwards correspondents write to the paper which has the effrontery to employ the critic pointing out that bis ideas are all wrong, and that he doesn’t begin to know his job ; this is the invariable result of the critic having the temerity to express an opinion on a subject about which he is supposed to be an expert, and if I, though nothing more than an amateur, can by publishing my selection provoke criticisms from other amateurs. or better still, induce them to send in their own selections, my time will not have been wasted. Copy for the Gazette is always welcome. Any selection such as this is bound to be more or less arbitrary, and to depend to some extent on the personal likes and dislikes of the critic. At the same time it is possible to achieve a certain impartiality, and in. an effort to do this I have taken about thirty of the best films that have appeared at the Sylvia Cinema since its opening, and after much thought have reduced this number to twelve. Here they are, in approximate order of merit :— Resurrection. Modern Times. Ruggles of Red Gap.. Mutiny on the Bounty. Lives of a Bengal Lancer. Les Miserables. Whipsaw. The Scarlet Pimpernel. The House of Rothschild. The Thin Man. Friday 13th. David Copperfield. It will be noted that of these twelve films ten are American, and not less than three have Charles Laughton as the principal actor. Frederic March appears in two, and Charlie Chaplin, William Powell, Spencer Tracy, Gary Cooper and George Arliss in one each. W. C. Fields, that prince of comedians, makes one appearance, and Aubrey Smith two. Of the female stars we can include Myrna Loy (twice), and Jessie Mathhews and Merle Oberon—both British—once each. A signi¬ ficant fact is that in no less than eight of the films mentioned there is no real love interest, which seems to. indicate that producers are at last realising that glycerine tears and sob-stuff are not essential features of a popular film, and that their absence does not necessarily spell disaster from the box-office end. This is a development which shows that Hollywood is at last becoming civilised. Apart from Charlie Chaplin and Charles Laughton, the finest individual performances were those of Elizabeth Bergner in "Escape Me Never," a film that purposely is not included in my selection; Spencer Tracy in "Whipsaw," George Arliss in "The House of Rothschild'' and Edward G. Robinson in "The Man with Two Faces,"—also a film that also does not appear in the list. In a rather different category comes Jessie Matthews, and we can at least congratulate ourselves that if British films are outnumbered by ten to two, we have in Jessie Matthews an artist who has no rival in her own field on either site of the Atlantic. This fact is now recognized, incidentally, in America. No survey of the Sylvia Cinema’s films would he complete without some mention of Walt Disney’s Silly Symphonies. This man of genius is incapable of producing a mediocre picture, and out of a number of cartoons that were uniformly good 1 select "The Grasshopper and the Ants,’ "The Tortoise and the Hare," and "Mickey's Band Concert" as the three winners. In conclusion, we will all readily admit that during the past two years we have had the mair essential on which to base a selection,—plenty of good material. —N.E.H. Films of the Month. OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER. The films shown at the Sylvia Cinema during the past two months have been both unusually varied and unusually good. We have had every conceivable type of picture,—comedies, tragedies, crook plays, musical plays, light operas, and leg¬ shows, and the names of famous stars have flashed before in us such abundance that we have found ourselves a trifle dizzy amid such a galaxy of the great. Every week there lias been at least one first-class film, and sometimes two or even three; and by the expression "first-class” I mean a film that holds your attention all the time, and that makes you feel that you have had real value for money out of the price of your seat,—so much so, in fact, that you are prepared to pay to see it a second time. Among these first-class films was one work of genius and four films of quite outstanding merit. These are, respectively, Modern Times, Whipsaw, Dangerous, Captain Blood, and Rose Marie. Let us take the work of genius first. When Modern Times appeared in London, some critics said that the film was a disappointment, and that Charlie Chaplin was losing his old mastery. It is not easy to understand this view, since apart from the fact that the silent convention undoubtedly 'dates,' and so makes the production seem a trifle forced and artificial in places, the film is well nigh perfect. "Chariot" is there again with his familiar bowler hat, his shrunken morning coat, his concertina trousers, and his shabby boots, and from the moment of bis first appearance he leaves us in no doubt he has lost no single spark of his old fire. Charlie is a genius, a prodigy, and evidence of this fact is stamped all over every foot of the film; each situation is perfectly contrived and perfectly exploited, each point is made at once, but never overdone. Our laughter is loud and spontaneous, and the close of each episode leaves us wishing that it had been longer; surely no higher praise than this can be given. In this picture Charlie again typifies the ‘little man,’ the outcast, the puzzled plaything of forces he cannot control and does not understand. Tn a way Modern Times is propaganda,—propaganda against the machine age with its tyranny, its blind worship of speed and efficiency, its ruthless suppression of all individuality. It is also a picture of the ‘Eternal Tramp,’ that pathetic rebel against modern conventions who is beaten, starved and harried from pillar to post, but who in spite of all this possesses something that is denied to the people who despise, reject and imprison him,—freedom. Freedom of spirit such as the slaves of the machine can never know. To do justice to Modern Times one would have to recount every episode in d il, which is impossible. We can only outline a few of the brighter moments in a film that was bright all the way through. Charlie the night watchman, for instance, roller-skating round a large and luxurious depart¬ ment store and punching the time-clocks with an airy nonchalance; Charlie in prison, unknowingly salting his dinner with cocaine and thereby achiev¬ ing an unusual truculence; Charlie in the patent feeding machine designed to eliminate lunch hours for factory hands, and so reduce working costs: Charlie having a nervous breakdown in the factory and gaily squirting the pompous faces of the Directors with lubricating oil; Charlie retrieving a red flag accidentally dropped by a passing lorry, and so all unwittingly becoming the leader of a communist procession.—each of these episodes is a work of art in itself, a jewel flashing out of the main setting of the picture, and the one occasion upon which Charlie becomes vocal,—when having lost the words of the French song he is to sing in a cafe, he manages to convey all the fire and verve of the original by means of unintelligible noises and more than Gallic gestures—is unforgettable. It is enough to say that at the dose of the per¬ formance we realised why the film had taken two years to make; we realised, also, that it was well worth all the care and money that had been expended on it. The incidental music, which was composed by Chaplin himself, is not the least of the attractions of this memorable entertainment. It fits in deliciously with the film, and lends it an added significance. In Paulette Goddard Chaplin has found an admirable leading lady,—easy to look at, intel- ligent, and what is much more important (though this is counted heresy in Hollywood), a finished actress. Even without the medium of sound to assist her, she caught to perfection the spirit of her part of a little street arab who finds her ideal in the tramp. Whipsaw was banned in Singapore,—why, good- nees knows. It is admittedly a crook play, since it deals with the successful pursuit of a gang of international jewel thieves by a G-Man. but it ends with the complete triumph of the law and includes only one scene of violence,—a piece of thrilling gun-play which lasts only a few seconds, and which surely could not have the slightest psychological effect on even the most ferocious of potential criminals. Whipsaw was superb enter- tainment in the style of The Thin Man.—a style which the Americans handle with such incom¬ parable efficiency. There was no dragging, and never an idle moment in the whole film; the story, which was exciting all the way through, and which worked up to a breath-taking climax, was admirably acted by a cast which was helped by first rate production. And when we say that in addition to all these advantages the G-Man was played by Spencer Tracy, and his quarry, the jewel thieves’ woman accomplice with whom he falls in love, by Myrna (what a woman!) Loy, it will be apparent that this was a picture well out of the ordinary rut. In Dangerous, a rather improbable plot was redeemed not only by the splendid acting of Bette Davis and Franchot Tone, but by polished pro¬ duction, which took one's mind off the unreality of the story, and which lifted this picture into the first-class grade. Captain Blood was another of Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer’s super-stupendous historical productions which came , as these ambitions films somehow seem to have a knack of doing when properly directed. It was very nearly as good, in fact, us Mutiny On The Bounty; all the scenes were well staged, and due respect was paid to the accuracies of the settings and costume. Rafael Sabatini's well-known story was followed fairly closely, and the result was an exciting and impressive film well worth watching. Some of the photography was splendid. Rose Marie although it took several liberties with the original story, gave us such good photo- graphy and singing of such unusual excellence that we forgave it the various departures from the Drury Lane plot, and listened entranced to Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy in their glorious rendering of the old favourites,—“Rose Marie” and "Indian Love Call.” To those who remember the Drury Lane chorus, the "Totem Tom-tom” song was disappointing, which is difficult to understand in view of the opportunities afforded by such a spectacular number. Other films worthy of mention are Show Them No Mercy, a kidnapping story, also banned in Singapore for no discernable reason. The Goose And The Gander, a comedy of modern America with Kay Francis and George Brent in the leading parts, and While Parents Sleep, a competent British production above the usual level. First Division News. OCTOBER. The following are extracts from a report by Mr. W. F. Dick, Resident First Division :— "1 left at 6 a.m. on October 12th on a visit to Simunjan, stopping at Sebangan, Jaie and Pendam on the way. The Sebangan Malays have made a road through their kampong and also a bridge over a stream which separated the upriver kampong from the bazaar; many new houses have been built and applications for more sites received, this all goes to show that the Malays in remote kampongs can be induced to take an interest in improving their kampongs when they are under the control of an energetic Native Officer. "Caterpillars which have been reported to have done so much damage to padi crops at 21st mile, Penrissen Road, and 26th mile, Simanggang Road, appear to have also done a lot of damage in the ulu Sadong and it is feared that there may be a shortage of padi in these districts next year; it is hoped, however, that the second crops sown may in many cases turn out well in spite of the late sowing.” Abang Zennorin. Probationary Native Officer, who arrived in Kuching on 13th October on transfer from Lundu, visited the following Land Dayak villages from the 21st mile, Penrissen Road, to the 15th mile, Simanggang Road.—Segu. Simpok, Setang, Petak, Sikok, Mambong, Sentah, Doras, Skrak and Quop. It would appear that these villages have heen visited once only by a European Administrative Officer during the past twelve years, and the report of ; Abang Zennorin’s tour makes it increasingly obvious that these villages should receive regular visits in the future. On October 21st. a verdict of death from drowning Was recorded at an inquiry into the death of an unknown Chinese whose body was found lying on the river bank in the vicinity of the Government Store, Kuching. Preparations towards Land Settlement in the Kuching District commenced during the month. All Tua-Tua Kampong have been informed of the advantages of, and reasons for. this Settlement of rights being undertaken. Further progress was made in connection with the bazaar scheme at the 10th mile. Penrissen Road. Notices of re-entry have been served upon people who have failed fulfil the conditions under which they received grants of land in 1917, and as a result of this action several Chinese have submitted appli¬ cations for shop-lots. Since all maintenance has ceased on the Simang- gang Road, a large hole approximately 8 feet x 14 feet x 13 feet has appeared at the 13th mile. It is now impossible for motor traffic to proceed to and from Serian. Unless this damage is repaired shortly, gardeners and traders along the road will experience great difficulty in obtaining supplies and in the transport of their produce. Two serious crimes appear in the records for Bau District for the month ; the first was a gang robbery at the 9th mile. Batu Kitang Road, where the Manager of Bukit Young Gold Mine was held up by a party of armed men and gold and cash to the value of about $4,000 taken. The crime was reported to the Siniawan police about 1.30 p.m. on the 23rd. The District Officer, Inspector Sirat and Police from Bau were on the spot some thirty minutes later. By 3.15 p.m. a strong force of Constabulary was Operating between the Bau District and Batu Kawah, investigations on the spot having indicated that this was the line of search. The Officer-in- Charge of the Sector. Mr. Kelley, took charge of the investigations that afternoon, and full details have already appeared in the . The gold has been recovered and several arrests have been made. The Constabulary are to be congra¬ tulated on their prompt response to the S.O.S. from Bau. and for the subsequent recovery of the gold. The gold miners themselves deserve little sym¬ pathy since escorts were offered some time ago, and refused; the gold is never insured, and the date of despatch is not always kept secret. It is only a matter of weeks since the District Officer expressed his surprise to the Manager of Bukit Young that no robberies had taken place in the past, giving as his opinion that the hick would not last. On the night of October 30th the Kim Lee Mine was broken into and gold slag to the value of $100 taken. The thief was caught and the gold recovered. The District Officer, Bau, mentions that the existing state of affairs in the Left-Hand Branch is far from satisfactory. The Orang Kayas and Tua Kampongs appear to be at odds with each other, while the hoi polloi appear to be at odds with their Chiefs. If a Chief settles a case in his kampong, the losing party invariably opens a fresh case with some other Chief, and so it goes on. Government has endeavoured to break this deplorable habit by forbidding Chiefs to settle cases from kampongs other than their own, or if one of the parties is from another kampong, then the Chiefs must co-opcrate. Chiefs have been instructed to give the litigants two or three weeks, or even a month, in which to proceed to Bau and appeal, while the people have been informed that if they fail to comply with the ruling, or to open an appeal within a reasonable time, they may be • dealt with by Government for failing to follow the order of the Chief, irrespective of any other case they may have attempted to open elsewhere. Complaints were received against Orang Kaya Batch of Senah Negri at Brang Blimbin, Semeru, Parun and Seremut, interference and improper fines being amongst the charges. The complaining Chiefs were promptly ordered to accompany the party to Senah Negri and thrash the matter out; they at once climbed down and not a single one came to Senah Negri. The truth of the matter is that the boot is very much on the other foot. Orang Kaya Batch is the only Chief who attempts to follow out Government rules, and who keeps his kampong in order. Being able to write he keeps records and reports of a sort, which are invaluable, and moreover he resents, and prevents, interference. This attitude docs not suit the other Chiefs at the moment, hence the com¬ plaints which there is every reason to believe are but a tissue of lies. Previously, Orang Kaya Batch’s advice and opinions were sought by all the Senah and Brang Chiefs; now. however, an objectionable man named Orang Kaya Japar has taken his place. Dalian Rubber Estates harvested 24,000 lbs. of dry rubber during October. Rainfall at Bau totalled 6.30 inches and at Dahan 13.00 inches. A number of padi fields were inspected during a visit to the Left-Hand Branch and appeared quite healthy; complaints of pests were, however, common. The Land Dayaks generally in the Ban District are against planting padi twice a year, the chief reason being a shortage of swamp land. They also say that pantang would he doubled and that they would therefore have little or no time for other pursuits. The average price of gold during September was $58.61 per fine ounce, the total production being 1930.283 ounces. The Oriental Company obtained their first gold during September, processing some GO fine ounces from 1840 tons of ore. The following table gives the individual output of gold from the various mines for September, 1936 :— This total of $6,518.38 is still fifteen hundred dollars short of what we hope to collect before the end of this year, for the Jubilee Bursary Fund. St. Michael’s Catholic Club, Kuching. ELECTION OF OFFICE-BEARERS. At the General Meeting held on the 1st November, 1936, the undermentioned gentlemen were elected Officers of the Club for the ensuing year :— Sarawak Regatta 1937.

DICK, Chairman, Sarawak Regatta, 1937. Kuching’s New Theatre. LILIAN THEATRE’S OPENING NIGHT. An audience of nearly 900 was present at the opening night of the Lilian Theatre, the palatial new building which has been constructed on the site of the former Globe Theatre. The proprietors generously allowed their first performance to take the form of a concert in aid of the Race-course Development Fund, and we Understand that as a result of their public-spirited action more than $1,000 was collected towards this deserving cause. The concert party itself was staged by the Sara¬ wak Constabulary Bangsawan Party, assisted by their "Good Companions,—a party of Europeans distinguished for their musical accomplishments— and great credit is due both to the organisers and performers for a thoroughly enjoyable entertain¬ ment. The show started at 8.30 p.m., and a packed house, which included Their Highnesses the Rajah and Tuan Muda, the Dayang Valeric and Dayang Anne, and leading members of all communities, sat down to enjoy a bangsawan that was well up to professional standard. The company were for¬ tunate enough to have secured the services of Miss Rose, late of the Manila Sunshine Revue Company, a charming and attractive actress whose talents were employed to very good purpose not only in the play itself, but also in the numerous variety turns with which it was interspersed. The Sarawakian Melody Makers, under the leadership of Inspector Abang Joini, played some attractive kronchong. and G. Solosa and His Band lived up to their reputation and provided some catchy dance music and numerous tuneful accompaniments. The Sarawak Constabulary Bangsawan Party again proved their worth as an entertainment team, all performers bringing to their parts a zest that ensured a successful evening. Inspectors Abang Haji Mustapha and Gregory Solosa were convincing as a Javanese and a Malay diamond merchant respectively, and Mr. Lim Ah Ann was first rate in the role of a Chinese goldsmith. Other members of the cast were uniformly good, but Mr. Lichai must be singled out for special praise; this actor is a born comedian if ever there was one, and his every speech and gesture showed a real sense of the theatre. He took the part of an Indian cloth merchant with outstanding success, and his entrance was invariably (and deservedly) greeted with laughter and applause. Some of the other actors, incidentally, would do well to take lessons from him in the art of voice production, since each syllable he spoke was audible at the far end of the hall, which unfortunately was not always the case with some of the other performers. The Bangsawan was divided into two acts separated by a musical interlude which was filled in by "The Good Companions." Mr. F. Harding rendered a tenor solo which was much appreciated, and the performance of the Harmonica Quintet consisting of Messrs. Kelley, Reid, Sinclair, Chater and Dr. Hutchison produced thunderous applause and repeated demands for encores. Unfortunately, Mrs. Kelley, who was to have given an exhibition of dancing, was prevented from appearing by a last minute indisposition, but her place was very ably taken by Mrs. Kennedy. Amongst the variety turns must be mentioned rhe "Drolleries" of Miss Rose and Mr. Lichai, in the course of which Miss Rose distinguished herself by playing a number of musical instruments, including a saxophone and a ukulele. This lady was also excellent in a song and dance scene. Our thanks are due to Messrs. The Borneo Co., Ltd., Sime, Darby & Co., Ltd., Chong Kim Eng and the proprietors of the Lilian Theatre, through whose generosity free refreshments were offered which naturally did much to contribute to the success of the evening. Rumours have reached us, incidentally, that after the audience had departed a further extemporary bangsawan was staged which continued until the small hours, and which eventually concluded on Pengkalan Batu where a few sleepy tambang men Were agreeably surprised to hear the strains of Malay music, and to see Miss Rose give a special song-and-dance turn. The following extract from the programme gives some account of the Lilian Theatre itself:— "The present is an excellent opportunity to congratulate the Proprietors now that after many months of hard work and planning, this magni- ficient building has arisen in Kuching's "West End." No expense or labour has been spared in introducing into this building almost every modem device and improvement in the interest of the comfort and safety of the audience. The interior, with its tasteful decoration, lighting effects, coloured flooring and arrangement of balconies, is spacious and airy. The number of windows is adequate and several ceiling fans are installed to keep the air fresh and cool. Built at an approximate cost of $65,000 to accommodate more than 800 persons, the Lilian Theatre combines the functions of a Cinema with that of a Theatre or Concert Hall and has the latest type of film projection and sound apparatus, and a large fully equipped stage with dressing rooms and orchestra pit. It is the largest place of entertainment in the town and its stage and stage-accessories fill a much needed want. The audience will he accommodated in comfortable seats allowing ample leg room, and an excellent and unobstructed view of the stage or screen is obtainable from the balconies and gallery. The sanitary arrange. ts also have been carefully planned and are most up-to-date. Two very spacious bars are provided within the building, and all manner of liquor will be on sale. Outside, a large car-park is in course of con¬ struction and a popular innovation is the allot¬ ment of space for small stalls from which ice-cream, fruits, chocolates, lemonade and native delicacies may be purchased. The building of this theatre has given employ¬ ment to many, all chairs and seats have been made in Kuching and the timber is, of course, all Sarawak grown. The material used in the construction and furnishing is almost ent’rely British, and we are particularly glad to notice the large number of rubber tiles used in the entrance and on the stairs. Every facility has been provided for an emergency, fire-extinguishers are placed at strategic points and sufficient exits to enable the entire Theatre to be emptied in one or two minutes. We wish the Proprietors every success in the future of their Theatre.” Below is a list of those responsible for the pro¬ duction and organization of the concert :— Third Division News. OCTOBER. On October 12th a Dayak named Jeluieng anak Engkulau was sentenced at Sibu to three years' imprisonment for harbouring an offender, the offence being punishable with death, with the intention of screening him from punishment. This is a similar case to that of the two Dayaks Makau and Sirat, who were tried early in the year for helping the rebels Kendawang and Kayan after the attack on the Kayan boat near the Pelagus rapids. Two coroner’s inquests were held at Sibu during the month, one on the body of a Chinese child which died on a motor launch between Sarikei and Sibu, and the other on the body of a Malay who died in a bandong between Matu and Sibu. Findings of death from natural causes were returned in each case. Mr. D. Duclos arrived at Sibu on October 6th and took over his duties as Assistant Superintendent of Rubber Restriction on the 7th. The Rubber Restriction Department is now housed in the Public Works Office. The Assistant Superintendent has made visits to all Checker-Supervisors and the experimental plots at Kanowit, Sungei Pradom, Binatang and Sarikei, and has found the work proceeding satisfactorily. The Lee Hua Sawmill was visited by the Divisional Forest Officer on October 10th. The mill was cutting kapor, of which the mill has a large stock, and small down-river geronggang. As a result of the prolonged drought this year the mill has no stock of hill softwoods. It is in the course of being extended th accommodate two extra benches for sawing belian attaps and the pendulum cross cut which has been purchased from the Kanowit Mill. H.H.M.Y. Maimuna arrived at Sibu on October 9th with the Dayang Anne, Mr. A. W. D. Brooke, the Resident and Mrs. Adams, and Miss Putnam. Mr. A. W. D. Brooke left later for Meluan, where he is to be stationed, accompanied by the District Officer, Meluan, Mr. A. Macpherson. Dayang Anne, accompanied by Mrs. Sochon, left for Kuching in the Maimuna on the 16th. During the last few days of October considerable floods were experienced on Sibu Island. These were due to the heavy fresh from up river, which brought down large quantities of driftwood, the accumulation of the months of comparatively dry weather. The District Officer, Lower Rejang, reports that very few Dayaks were seen during the month until the start of the tapping holiday, when as usual they came down in swarms. There are a considerable number of Kampar Dayaks from Kanowit, Song, and Kapit tapping rubber in this district. They are causing no trouble, however, and in most cases are heartily welcomed by the local Dayaks, who find they have not enough time io combine rubber tapping with successful padi-planting. Shortly after the departure of the Chinese Circus from Sarikei, a young unmarried Malay girl was found to be missing from the kampong. She was discovered the same evening in Binatang, disguised as a boy, and with her hair cut short. The attractions of the sawdust-ring (or of one of the performers in it), had apparently proved stronger than filial affection. Dayaks and Malays are all showing keen interest in the coming regatta at Sibu, but it is not expected that many boats will be entered from the Lower Rejang district. The knowledge that the Melanau boats will be racing has discouraged nearly all but the expert paddlers of Penghulu Kana’s district. Padi-planting is now complete throughout the Lower Rejang district, and applications are already being received for rat-poison. Leaflets concerning pig-poison for the protection of sago gardens were received from the Agricultural Department, and were distributed to planters in the Matu and Daro area. An effort is being made to induce the Melanaus to use more up-to-date methods in protecting their gardens from animal pests. It is interesting to note that with the low price of pepper and the rising price of rubber Binatang has now surpassed Sarikei in value of exports, haring nearly doubled the figures for last year. Just over 1,300 pikuls of pepper were exported from Sarikei. Big stocks are still being held for a rise in prices. The Court Writer’s quarter Sarikei, were duly completed, and were occupied by Mr. T. E. Parker, Settlement Officer, who will remain in this building until the completion of the new European bungalow. Tenders were invited for the construction of a third European bungalow at Sarikei, and negotia¬ tions were opened for the acquisition of a suitable site. Many new cracks have unfortunately appeared in the piling of Sarikei wharf being discovered during the exceptionally low tides early in the month. It is very difficult to discover and repair such cracks as they are normally under water at low tide. Full details of this damage have been reported to the Public Works Department. The cracks in Binatang godow are much worse, and the addition of further earth ing outside the walls has not. as the contractor expected, had the effect of springing the concrete beams back into place. The following is an extract from a report by Mr. F. L. Crossley, Acting District Officer, Lower Rejang :— "Accompanied by Abang Ottun, N.O., I toured the Dayaks of Penghulu Kana’s district, in the Lower Delta, from October 15th to the 18th, visiting ten houses in the Stubah, Mupong, Semah and Paloh. The fanning laud in this area is excellent, and has in the past given rise to bitter disputes between the Malays and Dayaks. Kana's people now seem to be living amicably with the Malays, but very bitter com¬ plaints were made by both Malays and Dayaks concerning the activities of Penghulu Ikau’s people. During the last five years these Dayaks, from the Leba’an and elsewhere, have been gradually drifting down into the Stubah and Mupong and fanning there without getting permission from the local inhabitants. The position is now so bad that Penghulu Ikau himself, who I understand has at present no long-house in his own district, spends most of his time in a so-called farming-hut of 30 doers right in the middle of Kana’s district, while others among Ikau’s anembiak have practically deserted their own long-houses and are living in similar ramshackle long-house fanning huts in the Stubah, Mupong, and even as far down as Paloh and Sedit. 1 recommend that Ikau be ordered back to his own district and stopped from fanning in Kana’s territory, and that his anem- biak be given the option of either building proper houses and coming under Kana's authority, or of clearing out. It will he recollected that it was Ikau and his anembiak who were responsible for tuba-fishing in Kana’s district last May, and that these people scoffed at the authority of Kana, whom I sent to stop the fishing." H.H.M.Y. Maimuna, with the Dayang Anne, Mr. A W. D. Brooke, the Resident and Mrs. Adams. Miss F. Putnam, and Rev. Fr. Epping arrived in Sarikei from Kuching on October 8th and left for Sibu on the 9th. The Maimuna party, together with the Sarikei European Officers, attended a performance of the Chinese Circus on the evening of the 8th. The District Officer, Meluan, states that there has been a good response to His Highness the Rajah's wish that Dayaks should plant crops other than padi. It is not expected that there will be any application for Government assistance from those houses whose padi suffered from rats and pigs as it is hoped that the large areas of empassa, etc., planted will be sufficient to tide the people over. Tn the District Officer's opinion, the enthusiasm shown is quite genuine and will be sustained. Enquiries for coffee seed are continually being received, and the Senior Agricultural Officer has been communicated with. If any particular variety of kapok is recommended, it is suggested that supplies of this seed could also be distributed. As much of the panto has been worked out in recent years, the planting of sago is also being encouraged, both as a substitute for rice if padi fails, and also for pig food. The number of pigs fattened by Dayaks for sale to Chinese is increasing, and this should prove a valuable source of income for them. As regards the Kanowit padi-farming experiment, the Dusuns have finished demonstrating in Ranan and Tuah. and have completed their irrigation surveys for the farms which will be brought into cultivation next year. The Rev. Father Klerk expressed his gratification at the industry displayed by Empam’s house in the Ranan, where he told the District Officer the entire population has been turning out daily to hoe their communal farm to assist the ploughing buffaloes which are still too young to do much hard work. It is to ho hoped that the Agricultural Depart¬ ment will be able to start the demonstration farm and plantations as soon as possible, in order that every encouragement and assistance may be given to ensure the success of this, for Dayaks, entirely new departure in padi farming. It is surely not too much to hope that the answer to the whole Dayak problem lies here. _________ The Rubber Improvement work continues, showing good results. The confiscation of badly smoked rubber is speedily having effect on Dayak producers and smokehouse owners. The District Officer, Meluan, states that it is to be hoped that the Poi Dayaks have learnt their lesson as regards tuba fishing, as a great deal of ill-feeling against T.R. Nyanggau has been expressed. Other rivets report a marked increase in "hand scoop" catches already as a result of the prohibition, and there seems to be general feeling of satisfaction about which is quite surprising. During the month a boat was bought for the new 9 b.p. motor at Meluan, with resulting increase in speed and economy. The boat with the engine in it got adrift during a spate. Both boat and engine were recovered, the former was unharmed but it is feared the engine suffered considerable damage through its six-day immersion. On October 27th a Dayak youth aged only about 9 years was charged at Kapit under section C—8 of the Tustin tunggu for causing the death of another youth aged about 13 years. Apparently accused, deceased and several other small boys on hearing a pig hunt taking place near the house, seized spears and reached the pig. which was being bayed, before the hunters; the pig on seeing them charged, and all fled for the nearest tree, but unfortunately the accused dropped his spear in the path of deceased, and the point being held up by brushwood entered deceased’s groin killing him almost instantly; the accused youth was severely warned and his father was ordered to pay $60 pati nyawa to the parents of deceased. Kapit Penghulus have been informed that at the forthcoming Sibu Regatta an aum will probably be held to consider the present tusun tunggu, and a considerable number of suggestions have already been received respecting changes in the present adat which they wish to bring forward. Engkabang in Kapit district is reported to have suffered from the incessant heavy rain at the end of the month, the fruit in many cases not having formed before the rains came. In the Katibas flowering was not good as it was in the Tekalit. As a result of high water a considerable number of logs have been brought down from above Kapit especially from the Oyan district. Chop Lee Hua (41 parties) rafted 437 logs to Sibu, and Chop Hua Seng (7 parties) rafted 40 logs. The following are extracts from a report on a trip to the Ulu by Mr. D. R. Lascelles. Acting District Officer Kapit :— "On October 8th I left Song for Katibas in the outboard, accompanied by Native Officer Abang Indeh and Penghulu Bedimbab. As the water was beginning to fall we decided to make hay while the sun shone and proceeded straight up to the house of Penghulus Sirai and Briak tor the night, arriving 4 p.m., after a short call at Rumah Empikau, Sungei Mean. Heavy rain occurred and the river began to rise again with the result that on 9th we were able to continue using the outboard and calling at Rumah Malleh, Rumah Serunggan and Rumah Rengan, we spent the night at Rumah Belaja. The day before we arrived a large crocodile had pulled an old woman out of a boat; she was rescued but died almost immediately from her extensive injuries. This crocodile has inhabited the particular pool for many years but apparently this is the first time anyone has been attacked. Tuai Rumah Belaja is probably Government’s most trusted ally in the Katibas, and I would place him before the Peug- hulus in that respect. "On 10th we reached the Pala Manoa Rumah Sliong for the night after calling at Rumah Baring. "Proceeding downstream on 11th we caught a glimpse of the guilty crocodile below Rumah Belaja but had no chance of a shot.” The District Officer, Mukah, reports that a further case of grave robbery occurred at Kampong Tega, and although very thorough investigations have been and are being made, and a reward of $50 has been offered for information, no arrests have been made so far. A tour of the ulu Mukah by Native Officer Abang Mustapha reveals the fact that Dayaks have but little, if any, of this year’s padi left, and that floods have already partially destroyed their newly-planted crops. It is hoped that activity in this district on the part of the Sarawak Oilfields. Ltd., may lead to a demand for their labour, which will relieve the situation. Messrs. Crowther and Lilley, of Sarawak Oil¬ fields, Ltd., Miri, arrived in the Mukah district during the month and requested permission to start access works, i.e., wharves, roads, bridges, etc., from Mukah to the 8.O.L. Camp at Sungei Matedieng. Permission for them to do this has been obtained. The Company has also obtained a concession for prospecting for oil along the coast, and inland from Sungei Matedieng. There has been a certain amount of tuba fishing in the Ulu Oya. A serious view is taken of this as Penghulu Untol is concerned, together with three local Tuai Tuai Rumah. A separate report has been submitted. The following is an extract from the report of Mr. J. C. B. Fisher. Acting District Officer, Oya:- "On October 5th Wan Hussein, Native Officer, proceeded to the Ulu Oya by outboard motor Paddy and travelled all districts. The objects of this visit were to collect outstanding tax and fines, hear cases, and give the usual routine orders. On 20th I left Dalat for Nanga Pakoh to meet Wan Hussein and Penghulus Untol and Chindang and discuss Ulu affairs with them on the spot. "Matters of importance to be attended to included the following :— (a) the rebuilding of various houses; (b) the area of jurisdiction of the Peng¬ hulus, which has got confused by houses moving from one river to another; and (c) a report concerning a tuba fishing held by Untol in August. "All these matters were attended to on the 21st at Nanga Pakoh. In connection with the latter it appears that Penghulu Untol and Tuai Rumahs Medan, Nyanau and Lumbok had all been tuba fishing during August. A serious view is taken of these cases as very definite orders had been given to these people personally be myself last April. A separate report has been submitted to the Resident, Third Division. "Dayaks in the Ulu are feeling the effects of their last bad harvest and are badly off for rice. Reports of this year’s planting are very favourable, however. "All outstanding tax for past years is now paid to date with the exception of some 20 doors for the current year. All outstanding fines have been paid.” Melanau fishing was at a standstill at Oya during the month owing to very rough seas. Reports received last month about the engkabang trees flowering in the Ulu Oya again this year, were confirmed. Judging by the amount of blossoms there should be a large crop this year. The price of raw sago increased again on the figures for last month, the price at Dalat being 80 cents per passu, and at the Kut 90 cents. This is the highest price recorded for two years. The amount of raw sago exported from the District showed a decrease compared with the figures for last month, the amount,being :— The Sunshine Manila Revue, a bangsawan which arrived from Mukah, played at Dalat to crowded houses during the month. Fourth Division News. -------------- OCTOBER. A month otherwise entirely free from serious crime at Miri was marred by two events; on October 21st Mok, Tua Kampong Dagang, was convicted on a charge of converting public monies to his own use, and was sentenced to one year's rigorous imprisonment. On the 31st a man and a woman were found killed in a lodging house in Jeraya Eu Seng. The inquest had not yet been held at the end of the month. Dayaks and Malays in the Niah, Sibuti aud Suai rivers are busy on their farms, and the bird’s- nests caves at Niah have just been opened. The nests are rather poor this year. The following table gives the Miri trade figures for October :— The new pig slaughter-house at Sungei Krokop, Miri, was put into use on October 19th, the old one being immediately pulled down. Several roads were repaired, and the road behind the European bungalows on Tanjong Lobang was completed. Minor repairs to Government buildings at Niah and Sibuti were carried out. A case of suicide, reported by Penghulu Wee, was investigated at Limbang. An old Tagal woman had taken tuba apparently in a fit of melancholia at not being able to return to North Borneo to see her equally aged sister. The reported epidemic of pneumonia in the ulu Limbang was confirmed by the Limbang dresser, who made a visit up river. About thirty deaths had occurred, and it is understood that this epidemic is annually recurrent owing to local climatic conditions. Quite a number of Muruts and Dayaks came down from the ulu to Limbang during the month, including Penghulu Wee, Dayak, and Penghulus Belulok and Tamanok Oyau (Tabun/Murut). Several matters were discussed and it appears that the padi planting has been satisfactorily completed everywhere. There were many applications from Dayaks for passes to work jelutong in other districts. Since the wireless engine at Limbang required the attention of a special mechanic from Kuching, the opportunity was taken to get all the telephone installations overhauled, and the local police were instructed in the rational manipulation of the Kubu switch-board. The Government monopoly of sales of ammu¬ nition has brought to light a few ancient unregis¬ tered weapons in the hands of far ulu Kelabits and Muruts. They have been confiscated. At a meeting of Tuai Rumahs which was con¬ vened at Sebauh, Bintulu District, on October 28th, the inhabitants of the Pandan River were informed that Jana anak Usop bad been appointed their Penghulu, as the district had grown too large to be managed conveniently by one man. Only one dissentient voice was raised and that was by a relation of the new Penghulu, who complained that it was difficult to get a meal in the Penghulu's room owing to the meanness of his wife. The new poison supplied by the Agricultural Department for getting rid of pests in the rice crops was distributed to all communities in the Bintulu district, but results are not yet to hand. Mr. Bormond of the Sarawak Electricity Supply, Ltd.. Sibu, arrived at Bintulu on the Auby in order to investigate the prospects of installing electricity at this station. He returned to Sibu by m.v. Margaret. The Rev. G. V. Summers of the Methodist Episcopal Mission, Sibu, arrived at Bintulu by the Margaret on October 29th on a visit to the Foochow colony, Sebauh. Towards the end of last month there was an outbreak of whooping cough in the Baram kampongs and bazaar. Almost every child below the age of ten years was infected, and two deaths were said to have occurred from this cause. The Curator of the Sarawak Museum arrived at Baram on October 22nd, and, accompanied by Native Officer Tuanku Mohamed, started for Long Akah on the 26th. He intended visiting the Pata and returning to Marudi from Long Akah by way of the Tinjar before proceeding up the Tutoh and Apoh. Since he left the river has been steadily rising, the kampongs and the bazaar are already flooded,—and it is doubtful whether he will be able to go much further than Long Kelimau. He has been commissioned to investigate the causes of the rice shortage and to make provision against a recurrence, and against the various pests, also to determine which villages are still in need of relief. The original vote of $5,000 was finished on October 10th. and a further $1,000 has been voted for emergencies, but to be used only at the discretion of the Resident; after, one presumes, the result of the Curator's investigations are known. The Tinjar natives, who have managed to last so far without relief, are now applying. They have been sent home to await the Curator’s arrival in their villages. From the latest news it seems that many villages above Long Akah will be able to last on rice substitutes planted until the harvest, and possibly another $1,000 in addition to that already granted should suffice for this year. Certain Kenyahs from the Akah returning home with rice obtained by Government assistance sank during the high water in rapids below Long Akah. Much of their rice and other provisions were lost. Mohamad Zin Galau returned from up-river on the 30th, and with his family narrowly escaped drowning near the mouth of the Tutoh. His boat struck a submerged log and filled with water. Fortunately a drifting tree trunk was nearby, and they all managed to cling to this until the boat was righted. Wan Suror, accompanied by Wan Haji Mohamad, left for the Bakong river on October 30th to arrange about the timber for Beluru fort, and to obtain the opinions of the inhabitants concerning a successor to Penghulu Rhu. The latter is very old and wishes to retire. After several days and nights of exceptionally heavy and continuous rain, a landslide occurred opposite Baram Fort and a portion of the bank has disappeared into the river, exposing the. rock beneath. The Lawas Courts were completely idle during the month, only one very small civil suit arising for decision. The Officer-in-Charge remarks that this possibly constitutes a record. There was, however, yet another inquest, bringing the number of sudden deaths requiring investigation during the year to a total of five, all these having occurred in the past two months,—again possibly a record for Lawas. This last inquest was on the body of a Brunei Malay who was taken from his prahu by a crocodile one early morning at Kuala Lawas. Medical examination revealed that the cause of death was drowning, the only injuries to the body being the crocodile’s teeth marked on deceased's head. A verdict of accidental death was returned. The following is an extract from a report by Mr. A. R. Snelus, Officer-in-Charge, Lawas and Trusan, on a visit to the ulu 'I spent a couple of days upriver visiting the Muruts in the ulu Lawas Damit and the lower reaches of the ulu Trusan. Farms appeared to be prospering aud good crops are indicated. All was very quiet and there were no cases to be settled nor complaints of any nature. I was surprised at the number of Muruts living in tiny padi sulaps. Long houses are gradually disappear¬ ing altogether, it seems, for the death rate is so high that when after two years it is necessary to build a house of four doors, there are probably only two families left alive. These two families then build two separate sulaps and live apart rather than join another long house. "Several Poi Dayaks arrived in Lawas at the beginning of the month to look for work, having travelled by Kuching. They spent about ten days in the ulu Lawas and brought down some damar, but the price they obtained for it was so poor that they decided it had not been worth the trouble.’’ The Lawas (Sarawak) Estates, Ltd., exported 36,736 lbs. of dry rubber during the month. — Visitors to Lawas were numerous during October. The District Officer, Sipitang, B.N.B., and his cadet assistant spent the week-end of the 10th - 12th at Lawas, bringing with them their local football team, who defeated the weak Lawas side after a vigorous contest in which four Europeans partici- On the 17th the Resident of Labuan and the Settlement Engineer arrived from Labuan in the Lady Clementi, departing again on the 19th. The District Officer. Limbang, arrived on duty on 23rd. He was followed by the Senior Forest Officer, also on duty, who arrived on the 30th and was still at Lawas at the end of the month. Badminton Tournament. DOUBLES. Inspired by the very interesting and successful tournaments held by the Kuching Badminton Associa¬ tion a few months ago, a number of members of the Junior Service stationed at Miri decided to put their heads together in an endeavour to promote badminton locally, and as a result a tournament on the knock¬ out system was arranged and concluded on 11 th November. 1936. Judging from the keenness of competitors and number of enthusiastic spectators present during the matches, it is anticipated that before long many more will take to this game, which is perhaps the only suitable outdoor recreation available here during the wet season. The results of the tournament are tabulated below:— THE . PRICE KUCHING, Wednesday, April 1st, 1936. 20 CENTS. The . WEDNESDAY. APRIL 1st. 1936. Death. At Kuching, Sarawak, Daniel Thomas Wynne James, age 59 years. Local and Personal. MARCH. His Highness the Rajah left for a visit to the North on March 30th, travelling by s.s. Darvel. His Highness, who proposes to visit Miri and Baram, expects to return to Kuching on April 11th. His Highness was accompanied by Dayang Valerie and Mrs. C. D. Adams, who arrived in Kuching from Sibu on the 27th. Dayang Valerie paid a short visit to Singapore during the month, leaving Kuching on March 7th and returning on the 16th. While in Singapore, Dayang Valerie was the guest of Air-Commodore and Mrs. S. W. Smith. His Highness the Rajah has very kindly presented a complete new set of instruments to the Kuching Military Band. His High ness� gift fulfils a long-felt, want, since a number of the former instruments were suffering from old age. Visitors to Kuching during March in cluded Mr. R. B. Willmot, H. M. Trade Commissioner, Singapore. Mr. Willmot, who passed through Kuching on his way North last month, was returning to Singapore after completing an extensive tour of British North Borneo. He left by the Vyner Brooks on March 25th. We note from the Engkilili report for Feb ruary that a Dayak Prisoner who escaped from Engkilili jail early one morning was peremptorily ordered hack to prison by his mother, whom he chanced to meet during his flight. He returned to duress the same afternoon. The moral of this little incident seems to be that aspiring prison-breakers should take care to avoid their near relations,�at any rate if they are Dayaks, who are notoriously susceptible to parental influence. The Rev. Father W. P. B. Shelly, C.R., returned to Kuching after a trip to Hong Kong on March 9th. His Highness the Rajah has kindly con sented to become the Patron of the Sarawak Badminton Association. A note regarding the formation of this association will be found on another page. Sport is booming in Kuching at the mom ent. Badminton courts are springing up in every kampong; Hockey which is a compar atively new development, is proving im mensely popular, and even �rugger�-is begin- ning to come into its own. A feature of this game is the increasing interest shown in it by Malays; under the tuition of a few Europeans enthusiasts there seems to be no reason why they should not eventually produce a very useful side. We may one day see a Rugby league in Kuching, and regular Rugby fixtures arc already well with- in the bounds of possibility. Formerly rugger matches were confined almost exclu- sively to Race Weeks, and the play was some times apt to he a trifle eccentric, to say the least of it. During the night of March 15th the General Post Office was broken into and a considerable quantity of registered mail stolen. Steps are being taken to render similar thefts impossible in the future. We record with deep regret the death of Mr. D. James, which took place at the General Hospital, Kuching, on March 21st. Mr. James, who was a noted research chemist, lived for many years at Goebilt. and had recently been working at Bau; his death, which was quite unexpected, came as a great shock to his numerous friends, both European and Asiatic. The funeral took place in the cemetery of St. Thomas� Pro-Cathedral on the after noon of the 21st. An appreciation of the late Mr. James will be found in another column. Mr. & Mrs. F. T. Merrill, who are on a round-the-world tour, arrived at Kuching on March 2nd. They left the following day for Sibu, where they hoped to see something of the Dayak life of the Rejang River. Mr. & Mrs. Merrill had recently made a prolonged stay in Bangkok after visiting India and Indo-China. Mr. H. B. Crocker, Acting Government Secretary, and Mr. C. D. Le Gros Clark. Secretary for Internal Affairs, paid a flying visit to Sibu during the month, arriving on March 10th and leaving the following day. Mr. A. Murray. Government Dentist, has been invalided from the Service owing to failing eyesight. We understand that he will be leaving Kuching early in April. It is becoming increasingly the custom, at any rate in Kuching, for brides at Malay weddings to be attired in European style, complete with orange-blossom, bridal veil, and bunch of lilies. Often enough, too. they are attended by flower-girls who act as train-bearers. One point in favour of this innovation is that it saves expense, the tradi tional finery being sometimes extremely costly. We are asked to state that a number of bound copies of Her Highness the Ranee�s play The Merry Matrons are available, price $1 and may be obtained on application to the Hon. Secretary. Kuching Amateur Dramatic Society. The proceeds of the sale of Her Highness� play are devoted to the assistance of the Society. A cricket team made up of Europeans from Kuching and Sibu is going to Miri at Easter, following an invitation from the Gymkhana Club. Miri. The last Kuching-Miri match was played nt Kuching in August, 1934. We deeply regret to report the death, which occurred on the night of March 21st, of Davang Haji Sadiah. the widow of the late Datu Temonggong. Dayang Sadiah, who was in her ninetieth year, was a close friend of Her Highness the Ranee Margaret, and also of His Highness the Rajah. An obituary notice appears elsewhere in this issue. The European population of Sibu has recently been suffering from a form of dysentery which is believed to have been caused by contamination of the water supply. Investigations are proceeding. The March number of Mirage maintains the high standard that we long ago came to expect from what the Editor (or should it he �Editress�?) rightly describes as our re nowned Quarterly.� The articles are as varied and interesting as ever, and make us more than a little envious : how does Mirage secure such excellent contributions? By bribery, flattery, or intimidation? For it is our bitter experience that no other means will induce the average European in Sarawak to take up his (or her) pen and write a column or two for the Gazette, and presumably what is true of Kuching and Sibu is true of Miri. At any rate, those responsible deserve a hearty pat on the back for bringing out a magazine that is a long wav ahead of the usual amateur production. We have only one very minor criticism to oiler, and that is to register a mild protest at Mirage�s persis tent mis-spelling of the word �Dayak�. Nobody writes �Kyan� or �Hari Rya� : why. then, �Dyak�? Mr. and Mrs. C. D. Le Gros Clark left Kuching on March 21st. Mr Le Gros Clark, who visited Malaya on duty in connection with rubier restriction, returned on March 30th; Mrs. Le Gros Clark is touring Java, and will he away for about a month. The discoveny that Sarawak Certificates of Identity were being extensively forged necessitated a visit to Singapore on the part of Mr. E. M. Selous, Acting Secretary for Chinese Affairs and Officer-in-Charge of Immigration. Mr. Selous left Kuching on March 25th and returned on the 30th. We welcome back to Sarawak Mr. and Mrs. W. F. Dick. Mr. W. Crocker, Mrs. C. E. Pascoe and Miss Patricia Pascoe, who arrived in Kuching by the Vyner Brooke un March 30th. Mr. Dick is to act as Government Secretary during the absence of Mr. Crocker, who is shortly proceeding to Europe on sick leave; he has also been appointed Chairman of the Commission that is to consider the Blue Report. The other members of this Com mission are Messrs. C. D. Le Gros Clark, F. H. Pollard, R. G. Aikman, with Messrs. J. B. Archer and A. Macpherson outstation members. We understand that Mr. Lowry will relieve Mr. R. F. Sinclair as Superintendent of Customs and Shipping, Fourth Division. Mr. Sinclair will return to Kuching. The final of the Billiards Tournament for European members of St. Michael's Catholic Club was played off at the Club on March 20th, the winner being Mr. W. J. Chater, who beat Mr. K. Cargill by 13 in a match of 100 up. Mr. Chater faithfully observed the old custom of filling the cup he had won with champagne and handing it round the spectators. An Appreciation of the Late Mr. D. James. The death of the late Mr. D. James took place, after a short illness, at the General Hospital, Kuching, on 21st March, 1936, at the age of 59. He was an old resident of Sarawak, having made this country his home lor the last twenty-three years. He was a very clever research chemist, and was readily accessible to anyone seeking his advice. All those who ever came into contact with him can testify to his many acts of kindness, and his unfail ing willingness to assist them on whatever technical points they desired information. To him money was a thing of no importance, since the mere pleasure in being able to render assistance of any kind to anybody was sufficient recompense to him. He was held in high esteem by all his friends for his sincerity and integrity in all his dealings with them; he was a man of the most retiring character, since whatever he did, he never wished it to come into publicity. By his death Sarawak has lost a very good citizen, for undoubtedly he did a lot of good work for the country.�Contributed.

RUBBER REGULATION. New Development in the Constabulary. FORMATION OF "SECTION B." On January 1st, 1932, the Sarawak Rangers and the Sarawak Police were amalgamated to form tlie force now known as the Sarawak Constabulary. This measure was carried out primarily in the interests of economy, but other factors were also taken into consideration when the re-organisation of the two forces was first proposed. During the years immediately preceding the amalgamation it had become increasingly evident that the Sarawak Rangers had outlived their usefulness as a purely military force; and by 1931 it was also obvious that reform was needed in the Police. The decade that ended in 1931 was on the whole a period of marked prosperity for the State, and in consequence development in all branches nf the Administration was rapid,�a little too rapid, indeed, according to some observers, for nowhere does the motto "Festina lente" apply more aptly than in the East. At any rate, the old rough-and-ready-outstation Police got left behind in the nice, and it was realized that unless something was done to raise the standard of the force it would be unable to cope with modern conditions. It was therefore decided to amalgamate the Rangers and the Police into a single force which would combine military efficiency with a high standard of competence in Police work. The object was successfully achieved with the help of an Adviser who brought to his task the fruits of many years� experience in the Malayan Police. The Sarawak Constabulary owes a very great debt to Mr. C. Hannigan who. with the assistance of local Police officers, completely re-organised the force and laid the foundations nf the Constabulary as we know it to-day. He instituted a new system of recruitment and training which has produced remarkable results in the comparatively short time that it has been in operation. A now type nf unstable has been produced who is noticeably superior in intelligence and education to the old outstation policeman, and as a result a great improvement can be noted in the smartness and efficiency of the force as a whole. At the same time, the Dayak troubles of the past few years have shown that there is still a lot to he said for the old style �roughneck� policeman, who. although he had never heard of the Criminal Pro cedure Code, could usually be depended upon to vanish into the blue and return with a wanted man three weeks (or three months) later. Sometimes, admittedly, he used rather questionable methods in effecting an arrest, but the fact remains that more often than not he got his man,�in the ulu, at any rate. His rough-and-ready methods were well enough suited to the jungle, and although in most cases his only qualifications for his job were physical fitness, a certain native shrewdness, and�most important of all �a thorough knowledge of the people with whom he had to deal, they were sufficient for what was required of him. and enabled him to carry out his duties satisfactorily. Though quite useless at controlling traffic or investigating a difficult case in the bazaar, he could pole and paddle a boat, and was prepared to scramble over high hills for days on end, if necessary. and live on the shortest of commons. A review of the conditions that prevailed touring the prolonged operations against Dayak outlaws in the Second and Third Divisions led Government to decide on the inclusion of a special military force within the Constabulary. This has been done, and the result is the force known as .�Section B�, which is at present in the process of formation. �Section B� is essentially a jungle force. It is destined for duty in the Ulu, and recruits are chosen with this end in view; literacy is not insisted upon, but recruits must be of first-class physique and reasonable intelligence. Their equipment is simple and eminently practi cal; it consists of a standard terendak�, an open necked shirt and shorts of dark green material, a leather belt and ammunition pouch, and a zinc basong�, in which are carried spare clothes and provisions. The men wear no boots or puttees, but a pair of light rubber-soled shoes are provided which can be put on when walking up a rocky stream-bed, or on any other occasion where some protection for the feet is necessary. When not in use, these shoes are carried in the basong. The men are armed with a .303 carbine and a standard parang. The advantage of a light carbine over the ordinary service rifle for patrol work is obvious. The bayonet, of course, is merely a nui sance and an encumbrance in the jungle, whereas a parang. in addition to being the natural weapon of the natives, can be used in a hundred and one different ways when on patrol. It comes in handy for clearing pathways, for instance, for cutting down trees and undergrowth, building shelters, chopping fire-wood, and so on. and it is also useful in a hand-to-hand encounter. The parang is to the natives of Sarawak what the kukri is to the Ghurka; with a parang in his hand he can face an enemy with confidence, but he is clumsy with a bayonet , which in any rase is not a suitable weapon for jungle warfare. "Section B" will eventually be split up into three platoons A, B and C, each composed of 34 non commissioned officers and men. Platoon A will garrison the new station at Nunga Meluan in the heart of the Third Division Dayak country; platoon B will be stationed at Lubok Antu in the Second Division; and platoon C will remain in reserve at the depot, and will supply relief N.C.O.�s and men for platoons A and B. There is no doubt that "Section B" will prove of great value in maintaining law and order in the interior. This small military force, will form a valuable complement to the main body of regular Constabulary. and will undoubtedly lie well fitted for the duties it will be called upon to perform 1 Conical sun-hat made of woven rattan. 2 Container made on the lines of a Dayak basket and carried on the back by means of shoulder-straps. Antimony in Sarawak. By L. SAMERESINGHE. Let us then be up and doing, To improve our country� s Fate; Still achieving, still pursuing, Learn to labour and to wait.-Longfellow. Antimony is a brittle metal identical in colour with tin, and crystalline in structure. It is rarely found in nature in a free state, and not in many countries. The chief source of the metal is stibnite, a mineral composed of two atoms of antimony held in chemical combination with three atoms of sulphur. On exposure to the natural weathering influence of air or water, the superior affinity fur antimony in stibnite of oxygen in the air or water brings about the displacement of the sulphur atoms, and antimony oxide is formed; but this chemical re-action, unlike laboratory re-actions, requires a prolonged period of time. The sequence of this change is naturally in keeping with observed facts in all antimony-producing countries, that the occur rence of antimony oxide as an outcrop is a never failing indication of a vein or lode of antimony sulphide or stibnite deeper down. The uses of antimony are numerous, viz., to harden alloys for anti-friction metals, for printer's metal, drugs, pigments, and last but. not least, for shrapnel. This last use sends up its price to sudden and absurd heights during times of war, and should the Abyssinian affray unfortunately develop into a world war on a big scale, an abnormal rise in price must inevitably- ensue. During the last Great European war the price of antimony soared up to ?130 a ton, and even at that exorbitant price its scarcity compelled the use of poor substitutes. Antimony ore almost always contains, more or less gold and silver, with traces of the rarer metals, and especially in Sarawak this is more the rule than the exception The process employed for the separa tion of these two precious metals is the condensation of the fumes resulting from the volatilization of the metal by furnace hear. The world�s production of antimony in the year 1926 was over 30,000 tons, and Bolivia, Mexico, France, Italy, Jugo-Slavia and China were the principal producing countries. The province of Hunan, China, produced more than half the world�s requirements, and the Hunan Antimony Syndicate, composed of the Hunan Government, the miners and smelters, was incorporated within recent years with the sole right of export, and to control pro duction with a view to securing better prices. In 1926 this Syndicate contrived to raise the price in the world's markets to �100 c.i.f. London. Mexico then ventured to compete with China, and, favoured by reason of her proximity, ousted China in the American markets, but China still retains a predominant position in European capitals. Japan is the biggest buyer, and in view of her nearness to Sarawak, it would be very interesting to investigate the possibilities of increasing production in the State of Sarawak, where nature seems to have stored up antimony in lavish abundance. It is not outside the realms of possibility, and, in the opinion of the writer, is even within regions of probability, that Sarawak will rival China some day in the not too distant future, should some scheme on the lines of the Hunan Syndicate be framed, embodying such modifications and additions as would be consistent with local requirements. To those uninitiated in matters of this nature, and to others interested in the export trade in minerals, the cogent reasons for advocating the introduction of such a scheme may remain obscure. The outstanding broad disparity between the local price, in the neighbourhood of $3 per picul, a sum sadly inadequate to cover even cooly labour and transport expenses, and the pro fitable quotations at. which exporters sell to metal merchants in Europe and Japan, disclose a situation of discord that is pregnant with cause for complaint and valid grounds for demanding a satisfactory explanation. There is genuine justification for maintaining that if earnest endeavours to induce vigorous search for the mineral be fostered and encouraged by the accompaniment of a correspond ing appropriate reward, more deposits will be discovered and worked; but the fact must not be forgotten that in the absence of a fair profit to the miner commensurate with the London or Osaka market. and framed to defeat the trade tricks of exporters, a tendency to militate against the funda mental features of the scheme would arise. The accumulated results of painstaking scientific research and steady progress in the manufacture of alloys made since the advent of the electric furnace, which largely does away with the deficiencies of the human factor, and requires most delicate and laborious experiments, secretly pursued in the State aided laboratories of the Great Powers both for destructive and constructive purposes, have com bined to push on antimony to a prominent position amongst the minor metals; such minor metals, that is to say. that were left to idle away from the dawn of the chemical age without uses being found for them through ignorance of their valuable attributes. They are now finding new "billets" and displacing those hitherto used and considered as being obsolete or not "up to the mark" to-day. The metallurgical chemist is ever trying to bring into being a better and better alloy, cheaper in price, of enhanced ability to withstand variations and temperature, increased resistance of oxidation, and wear and tear. greater lightness, and greater durability than the one now in use, or an entirely fresh alloy suited to the requirements of some special constructional part of machinery of recent invention. In this inventive age. antimony may be counted upon as one of the minor metals, indispensable in industry, and in view of the inquiries from Japan, it is not unreasonable to draw the inference that a use has been found for the metal which will most assuredly be kept as a well-guarded secret. Economy and efficiency are the two leading and vital factors, on which metallurgists are basing their experimental studies amongst the minor metals. In this short and inadequate account of antimony it is decidedly filling to make a. reference to the fact that the first Rajah of Sarawak was aware of antimony becoming a valuable asset of the State, and the remembrance of this fact ought to engender a grateful sense of appreciation, which would con vey considerable support for any scheme designed to increase production and confer on the small miner the benefits of a moderate margin of profit. Rotary Doctrines Preached in Kuching. Mr. Khan Ah Chong, a Past Vice-President of the Kuala Lumpur Rotary Club, has been appointed a Special Representative of the Governor of the 80th District R.I. with a view to the forma tion of a new Club at Kuching, Sarawak. A dinner was given by him at the Government Rest House on the '29th February in order that some of the Rotary doctrines might be preached to those Who might take interest in the Rotary movement. There were present about 30 guests comprising some of the Government officials and the leading Asiatic merchants, etc. After the usual pre liminaries of thanking those concerned in the loan of the Rest House and in the arrangements of the dinner and the guests for having so kindly accepted his invitation Mr. Khan Ah Cong said :� "There is one thing about which I am sorry and that is I did not invite the ladies, because there is a very unfortunate ruling in Rotary that at business meetings no ladies arc permitted. Whether this ruling is fortunate or unfortunate I will not argue that point here but personally I think, dinners once in a way, without lalies are very welcome. They certainly breathe an air of freedom, you don't have to observe any conventions or etiquette. You can discuss and talk about things freely and I hope you thus enjoy yourselves to-night." He went on to say that he first came over here in May last year and the first thing that struck him after a few days stay was that the people were living very peacefully. "As I stayed longer" he continued "I studied the economic life of the community as a whole and there appears to me that there is not much unity and co-operation existing among the cosmopolitan crowd that forms the popula tion of the place, as each creed is carrying on its profession or trade quite separately and independently. I may be wrong but that has been my observation. I pondered over this condition of life and came to the conclusion that to bring about unity and co-operation it is only Rotary that can do it and if the lack of unity is any evil at all, it is only Rotary that can remedy it. Therefore I considered that a Rotary Club is very desirable here. I communicated with the District Governor, H. R. H. Prince Purachatra, at Singapore. He was satisfied with my report and also with the knowledge of Rotary that I possess through having been connected with it for number of years and having held a number of posts of responsibility. I was then appointed a Special Representative and therefore I am hern to convert some of you to be Rotarians. Some of you maybe wonder ing and asking why do I want to form such a Club here and what benefit do I get from it. Lot me tell you that 1 do it purely out of my Rotary spirit because it is the duty of every Rotarian to promote the formation of new Clubs wherever and whenever they arc desirable. The theory of waiting for a community to want Rotary is fallacious, it is the duty of every Rotarian to create in a community a desire for Rotary. Another reason is that I have every confidence that Rotary in time will prove beneficial to the Members themselves, to the Government, and to the public. As to the point of what benefit I expect, I can assure you that I do not expect any. I am not paid for the job and whatever benefits I get, will be those as other Rotarians enjoy. I will now try and give you some of the fine qualities of Rotary. Rotary was founded in Chicago, U.S.A., in the year 1905 by an American lawyer named Paul P. Harris. When he opened his law office there, he had much time for reflection and pondered much on conditions of life and business in a large city, where to outward appearances the chief stimulus to human activity was not the Golden Rulo but the desire for gold and silver. As a result of his studies and reflections Mr. Harris had formulated a definite philosophy of business relations. He had by this time made some friends and called together three of them each of whom was engaged in a different line of business He expounded his theory of them, that was to draw one man from each recognized business or professional or institutional activity in the community to form a Club, to meet to gether wherein the members might not only become acquainted with one another, not also device means of making themselves proficient in thoughtfulness of, and helpfulness to, each other. A club was then formed but at first the members did not inert at luncheon but met in rotation at the offices or places of business of the various members, and from this rotation the word Rotary had sprung up. At first it took a long time for Rotary to take root, because it was not until 1910 before a second Rotary Club waa formed and I hat was in Canada. After that Rotary spread like wild-fire, and the latest statistics available up to 20th December last year give the total number of Chibs all over the world at 3,899 with the addition of Iceland aa the latest recruit. The total membership on 20th December, 1935, was 164,773. From 1910 to last year, that is a lapse of 25 years, new Rotary Clubs had been chartered on an average of one every two and one-third days. There are something like 340 Rotary Clubs in the British Isles and about 45 in the London area alone. It is in London, therefore, that you find probably the most intensified group of Rotarians in the world. What then is the secret of Rotary�s strength and universal popularity equally in all nations and with all people? There are so many answers tn it, and the following arc a few of them. If Rotary is not worth while the 164,000 odd of the leading men in the various countries won Id certainly not become part of it. Its motives are good, because it places its methods, its aims and objects, frankly before the world, and is open qually to the member and non-member; its efforts are sincere because it tries to bring people into close friendly contact; it has no secret? because it appeals to all creeds and ignores all national boundaries; its is non-political therefore it can never he wrecked on the rocks of political arguments, since it demands of its members first of all good citizenship; it is non-sectarian because it has shocked no faith and offended no custom: it has no mystic rites; it arouses no greed, because Rotary can never be accused of selfishness or profiteering or the acceptance of membership to benefit financially one�s business or profession; it can never be accused of disloyality since it stands for the rights of nations and believes in patriotism; it is not even a pacificist organiza-tion; it believes that participation in certain wars has been necessary in the past, it can foresee conditions by which participation may be necessary in the future. It does desire, however, to do what it can to increase tolerance, and lessen misunderstandings and hatreds between nations that there may be avoided the atmosphere in which wars flourish. Rotary does not feel that there is anything in loyalty to one's country that is incompatible with deve loping friendship with men of other lands. In fact Rotary believes that the citizen who bcst serves his country is the one who wishes to know the truth about his neighbours and who desires to replace hatreds between nations and people with friendship. International friendship, how ever, is not by any means Rotary's only objective. There arc also the community and vocational services along which Rotary can achieve quite a lot. A Club in a community will, after careful study, help with the thing that in the light of local conditions seems the most important for it to turn its hands to. One cannot expect to do much in the development of a world friendship without friendliness at home. We have here men of several racial groups. They are representative and influential men in the community. Do what you can then to develop and maintain tolerance, good-will and co-operation and even if there is no other objective the formation of a Rotary Club here is well and fully justified. There is no other explanation for the great and rapid spread of Rotary all over the world than that the Rotary idea works and that Rotary is well worth one's attention. One of America�s famous cynics. Sinclair Lewis, stated quite a number of years ago while he was in England 'I assert that the growth of Rotary in Great Britain where it already has hundreds of chapters is more im portant for world tranquillity than all the campaigns of the reformers put together. Rotary appeals strongly to me because of the work that it is doing in building up the world fellowship. I assure you, gentlemen, that friendship between countries can never be ? brought about by treaties or by the kind won! of diplomats regardless of the desire of official dom for it. International amity can only come about through the world desiring friendship. And friendship is not brought about by merely the acceptance of it as an ideal. It must be brought about by contact. Now Rotary brings about this conflict by making it one of the obligations of a Rotarian that he attends Rotary meetings wherever he may be. While your membership is in one Club your attendance need not be there only. You may attend any where in the world and the Rotarians of other countries have equally the privilege to attend your meetings. Thus we have 164,000 odd Rotarians in about 65 different countries fra ternising together in a close and splendid fellowship at every possible opportunity. We believe that if we meet a man and like him we will like Ins country just a little bit letter through liking him. Rotarians are of a class who travel much. They attend Rotary Clubs wherever they may he. That is their duty. We know they go home with a friendly feeling for the countries which they have visited trough their contact with Rotarians. They express their opinions in their Clubs, in their craft associations, to their friends outside and then, like a wave, their friendliness for their neigh bours passes out further and further and we know not where it will end. Most of the dislikes, most of their hatreds that exist between countries and nations are due merely to lack of contact. We do not speak badly of our friends and we do not wish to quarrel with them. Our friendships must not be limited to the boundaries of our own nations. Just so long as we permit ourselves to live in exclusive groups, to ignore the other fellow, to allow our nationalism to make us quite content to associate solely with those of our own nationality and to believe in them alone, then just so long do we encourage intolerance and even bitterness that can easily have serious results. At present there are over 1,000 club bulletins issued by Rotary Clubs throughout the world and Clubs of different countries combine in getting out some really first-class magazines. In all the publications you cannot read a word of abuse of other countries or of other people. Rotary, I am happy to say, is the cult of those who wish to think well of their neighbours and who desire to dwell on their virtues rather than on their defects. No speaker at a Rotary Club meeting is expected to speak in criticism of countries with whom we are at peace. It is not that criticism is not sometimes desirable, it is not that criticism is not sometimes necessary. There are, however, so many people going about the world, so many agencies, so many news papers. so many books, and I fear I must say, so many religions, that are dealing with other people's defects that Rotary believes there should be just a little room somewhere for an organiza tion that desires to specialise on friendship. Each of us has our own defects and in over looking our neighbours imperfections we trust he will be equally desirous of overlooking ours. In fact is it not almost necessary, if we are going to avoid great wars in the future, that tolerance and appreciation and co-operation be taught somewhere? Rotary is often spoken of as a bridge builder became it can construct bridges wherever there are gaps occurring so that one section of the community can cross over to the other and vice versa whereby one section may be in a better position to understand the other's views, their happiness, their joys and their pro blems. Rotary has six objects as follows :- To encourage and footer 1. The ideal of SERVICE as the basis of all worthy enterprise. 2. High ethical standards in business and professions. 3. The application of the ideal of service by every Rotarian to his personal, business and community life. 4. The development of acquaintance as an opportunity for service. 5. The. recognition of the worthiness of all useful occupations and the dignifying by each Rotarian of his occupation as an oppor tunity to serve society. 6. The advancement of understanding, good-will and international peace through a world fellowship of business and professional men united in the ideal of service. and its motto is :� "Service above self." "He profits most who serves best." Rotary is a far-reaching movement and for such a movement to be a real force in society it must have a defined programme which a Rotarian can carry out in four avenues or directions, namely :� First.�In Club service which means a Rotarian�s contributions in attendance, fellow- ship, programme participation, etc., in his Rotary Club. Second.�In vocational service which means his service in his business and in the general trade of which his particular busincss is a part. Third.�In community service which means doing his good-sized bit as a neighbour and a citizen. Fourth.�In international service which means widening his horizon and extending his view beyond international boundaries, the doing of things for men in other countries that will help and make secure the good relations now existing between his country and other countries and prevent the development of strained relation and wars. These four channels can be very much more amplified, but I have no time for it. Rotary is administered by an international Board the members of which change each year and are elected at an International Convention hold yearly. As evidence of the international nature of the organization I will give you the 1935-1936 constitution. The President is a man clawed under (railroad commissary contracting) from Virginia, named Mr. Ed. R. Johnson. The First Vice-President is a man from Cape Town, the Second Vice-President is from Spain, the Third is from San Francisco, and the ten Directors comprise men from England, Canada, Chile, New Zealand. Missouri, Denmark, Arkansas, Colorado, Michigan, and New York. These men actually meet together two or three times a year, the President giving up his entire time to Rotary. Of course, officials all serve in an honorary capacity.� Mr. Khan Ah Chong then wound up his address by reading the latest of the District Governor�s letters in which were included the following information :- District Conference at Ipoh, F.M.S., on April 4th and 5th. Inter District Visits. Conference at Kobe on May 2nd and 3rd. Bangalore Conference comprising of India, Burma and Ceylon on 27th to 29th February. Young Australian Visitors being entertained by Rotarians. Community Work by Malacca Rotary Club. Mr. Ed. Parnell then rose and thanked Mr. Khan Ah Chong. He stated that he had known Mr. Khan Ah Chong for about 7 years and had found him to be very energetic, capable and experienced. lie also stated that during his over 30 years' stay in Sarawak he had seen quite a number of public bodies, etc., die their natural deaths through subsequent apathy on the part of the original promoters, but lie hoped that Rotary would be an exception and that it would flourish under the able guidance of Mr. Khan Ah Chong (hear, hear). After that the crowd adjourned to the lounge where they had liqueur and coffee and chatted till well over 11 p.m. before the crowd dispersed. A Sad Thought. One of those figure fiends who has been con templating retirement for some time has asked me to place on record, for the guidance of any other readers who may be toying with the idea of return ing to England permanently, the fact that if they invest ?1,000 at three and a half per cent, the yield will be just sufficient to provide them with a bottle of whisky a week, presuming they are successful in Setting a small return on the empty bottles.-"ANAK SINGAPURA" in the Straits Times. Air-Commodore Smith's Story of R.A.F. Flight. ADVENTURES IN STORM AND FOG. HOW THEY HEARD OF TOKIO REVOLT. Air Commodore Sydney Smith, Air Officer Commanding the R.A.F., Far East, who has just returned to Singapore after having led the greatest flight that has been carried out so far by the R.A.F. in East, told his story to the Straits Times of the goodwill journey of the three Singapore III's from Seletar to Sarawak, British North Borneo, the Philip pines, and China. Air-Commodore Smith was informed of the Tokio disturbance, which caused the can cellation of the flight to Japan, by Admiral K. Oikawa, Senior Japanese Naval Officer at Shanghai. Through the British Air Attache at Shanghai, Group-Captain R. P. Willcock, Admiral Oikawa expressed his deep regret to Air Commodore Smith that the trouble in Tokio had made it impracticable for him to continue his flight to Japan in the Singapore Ill�s. The R.A.F. fliers were given a great reception at all the places they visited. Their reception in Shanghai and Nanking was particularly cordial, said Air-Commodore Smith. The flying boats had many adventures of storm and fog, engine trouble and landings on choppy seas. Air-Commodore Smith said that the first delay was at their first stopping place�Kuching. There was an incessant storm from 4 a.m. to 11 a.m. with no visibility. The Kuching authorities said it was the most violent storm in history. There were trees and debris on the river, and it would have been madness to take off with a heavy load. They left next morning for Kudat, British North Borneo, where they stayed the night. Early next day they left for Manila. About 100 miles from Kudat one engine failed in the Singapore III which was carrying his flag. Wing-Commander Scott, who was in charge of this flying boat, kept it cruising comfortably on three engines. The aircraft only lost five knots in speed, and formation was maintained. At Manila examination proved that the engine that had failed would have to come out. They signalled Hong Kong to Bend a Rolls �Kestrel� engine. The other two flying beats then left for Hong Kong. He had transferred his flag from Wing Commander Scott's aircraft to one under Squadron Leader Lloyd's command. Leaving Manila at 6.15 a.m., the flying boats passed over the Pratas Reef, where the City of Cambridge could he seen stranded. Al Hong Kong a guard of honour was provided by the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, and a salute was fired. The next stage of the flight was eventful. Air-Commodore �Smith said that the flying boats waited at Hong Kong until 11.30, hoping that the fog would clear away. About 100 miles out on their way to Amoy the fog closed down. I have never seen thick fog form so quickly,� said the Air-Commodore. "We also had informa tion that the. fog was thickening near Amoy, and we had no alternative but tn return to Hong Kong. �Next day was still bad, with fog and drizzle. On that day Wing-Commander Scott flew his engine direct from Manila to Amoy. He was north of the worst weather, but he struck a storm south of Formosa. "We decided also to fly direct to Shanghai, but the weather was unfavourable, and we had to come down at Amoy. "At Amoy one of the engines in Squadron-Leader Lloyd's boat showed a defect, and it hud to be replaced from Hong Kong. Wing-Commdr. Scott's and Flt.-Lieut. Riccard's boats flew on. "After passing Foochow the weather became worse. The fog closed round us, and we decided it was inadvisable to go on. We landed on Nam Quam Bay. and dropped anchor in choppy water. �Immediately we were surrounded by sampans. The Chinese in this region had never seen anything like this before. �On the hills thousands of black-clad Chinese swarmed in a few moments, and more junks and sampans arrived. "When the tide went out, we lay high and dry on the mud, and then we saw an amazing spectacle. Chinese began to swarm round the flying boats on peculiar wooden scooters, which they pushed across two feet of soft mud. They tapped the hull and wings, and were very curious, but none of them could speak English. "We slept in the flying boats all night, and the sloop H.M.S. Sandwich arrived from Hong Kong. It was impossible to take off for some time, but eventually we got away to Shanghai."�Straits Times. Bridge Hints From �The Butler.� CONTRACT FOR CLUBMEN. Valuing the Hand. It is vital that an accurate valuation of the hand should be made. Disastrous aud unpleasant con sequences follow inability to settle the score occasioned by too many bids. Always remember that the more quick tricks you have, the better; they will get you out of many tight corners, and if you play these tricks properly you are certain to put many of your opponents� bids down (but see �Rule of Eight" infra). The Rule of Eight. Under normal conditions, eight is considered to be a maximum (for abnormal conditions "One over the eight"). This latter case is usually the result of having under-valued one's hand and over-valued one�s capacity. Bidding and Responses. Before you bid, always look at the score�for example, if you stand three, make sure that, the other players also stand three before you raise to four. If, however, you have learned bidding on either the Hounsditch or Aberdeen system�always let the others open the bidding, and if possible make no bids yourself. While one may save money by the use of these systems, one is apt to lose caste, and they are not recoin mended. Keep your eye on the score,�this is most important, as inability to meet the demand bids are apt to lead one into deep water (always to be avoided), and finesse will he necessary to avoid the grand slam. Responses can either be negative or positive� the greater number of quick tricks you hold the more positive should your responses be, more especially when anyone has interposed with a bid. Doubling. If your partner has not bid, and your score sheet is empty�you may double any original bid by the others. This shows great strength, and partner should reply by showing his preference either by calling a major (or double), or a minor (single), or a no trump (stengah). "Flag Flying." This is deliberate overcalling in order to save one's face�The method is this�If in danger of too much going down, so that it may possibly come up, immediately either double any call or call three or four. This will unsettle the others, and you will pro bably get a negative response. Only in cases of extreme weakness should this be resorted to. and here is a table showing the risks it is worth while taking. After 1st Round�up to 8 2nd ,, 7 3rd ,, 6 4th ,, 5 and so on down to the 7th Round, after which as an exception 3 should be called�at this stage such a call has a most demoralising effect. Note.�It is essential that any bids of this des cription should always total to at least �one over the eight.� Systems. The �One over one"�is the oldest, safest and most popular, and as it implied, means that each player calls in relation, no doubles or re-doubles being permitted until "one over the eight� has been reached. The Natural Bid. When using this system, a bid means exactly what it says. Vulnerability. This implies entering a game after one has made several bids by oneself, and the others have just started a round. The newcomers are non-vulncr able until each has either made or accepted a bid. Once a person has become vulnerable by accep tance of a bid, he is in honour bound to make a bid himself. (But see notes on bidding on Houns ditch and Aberdeen systems supra). The One Club Convention. The two most famous examples of this convention are the Barton Club (not very satisfactory), and the Canadian Club (eminently satisfying). The latter is a very potent convention, and should be sparingly bid for. Forcing Calls. Be chary of using these forcing calls-the golden rule is "Let your partner speak : don't make him.� If your partner cannot support you it is useless to force a bid from him, as in that case you may have to meet the score when the bid has gone down. You must always have great strength and a good many quick tricks to force partner to bid. Imperial Airways Ltd. 14th March, 1936.

Recently two trawlers transhipped 200 tons of frozen fish caught in the Indian Ocean and Aus tralian waters. One of the vessels had 2,000 pack ages of frozen bream and red porgy, caught off Western Australia. Frozen fish are transhipped at Singapore to vessels which take it direct to Japan. Most of it is for domestic consumption, as the Japanese are big fish-eaters, but some is made into fish meal and exported to all parts of the world. Japan boasts, according to the British United Press, that her fishing industry is the biggest in the world. With a view to further expansion scientists are travelling on the trawlers operating from Singapore to investigate ocean fishing conditions. Their re ports are forwarded to a new research institute ou ocean fisheries.�Sunday Times. Films of the Month When Charles Laughton's name appears on a programme, no one bothers very much about the film. For one thing, it is taken for granted that no directors in their senses would dare to feature him in a second rate picture: for another, his reputation is now such that it would not make very much difference if they did. It is Laughton who matters, and not the story. When he is on the screen, deficiencies of plot and production arc forgotten in the thrill of watching the finest of contemporary character actors. Laughton by him is sufficient entertainment for most of us. This altitude, which at first sight appears mere hero-worship (crooners and matinee idols ran com mand much the same kind of blind adoration from thoir fans), is justified by events. Each time Laughton appears in a new picture we wonder whether he will maintain the high standard he has set for himself; and each time he not only main tains it, but surpasses it. Laughton, as an actor, is in a class by himself. He is a phenomenon, a prodigy, arid we can only wait in breathless amaze ment for each fresh triumph, knowing with utter certainty that it will come. During March, we were ablc to see this remark able actor in two widely different roles, and in each of them he was perfect; there is no other word for it. As Javert in Les Miserables he brought to life a character so psychologically absurd that in the book it never really begins to live. This is no mean feat. The average talkie audience is more critical in this respect than were most of Victor Hugo�s contemporary readers, brought up, as they were, in the tradition of early Victorian melodrama. In the book, Javert was never quite credible, yet in the film he lived. Laughton's subtle alchemy turned the stony-hearted warder, the relentless and inhuman police officer, into a living being in whom we could believe. Moreover, much as we might hate him and all that, he stood for, we could not but respect him, for Laughton invested this most unlovable figure with a strange dignity. Javert's magnificent outburst when Valjean pardoned him after he had denounced himself for an error of judgment that had put him, the fanatical guardian of the law, within reach of the law, was extra ordinarily impressive. So, too, was the scene in the Paris sewers, when Javert, at the mercy of his victim, he refused to deviate one inch from his duty, knowing that this refusal would almost certainly cost him his life. And if his final suicide was unconvincing, that was not the fault of Laughton, but of the directors, who, incidentally, were for once justified in �cooking� a story to provide a happy ending. All hough artistically a mistake, Javert�s suicide was emotionally necessary; Victor Hugo's sombre masterpiece would otherwise have been altogether too harrowing. Fredric March gave the performance of his life as Jean Valjean, the hero. As the embittered galley-slave sent sentenced to ten years' of hell for the theft of a loaf of bread; as the successful business man and magistrate, who had built up a new life out of the ruins of his past as the hunted fugitive fleeing always from the wrath to come in the person of Javert, he was superb. Each phase of Vaijean�s eventful life was portrayed with understanding and a real sense of dramatic values. Fredric March has achieved a high level of technique, and is an actor gifted both with talent, and imagination. Sir Cedric Hardwicke was excellent as Bishop Bienvenu, a sympathetic but difficult part in which the slightest lapse into sentimentality would have spelt disaster, and the remainder of a strung sup porting cast all contributed to the success of an exceptionally good film, and one, moreover, which has a moral which should not be lost on us to-day. Victor Hugo's story is melodramatic, certainly, but it is also impressive, chiefly becanse it is the impassioned protest of a great thinker against man's appalling cruelty to man,� or rather, against the unthinking cruelty of the ''haves" to the �have nots.'' And incidentally, if we consider ten years in the galleys rather a stiff sentence for stealing a loaf of bread, do not let us forget that less than a century ago farm labourers in England were transported for poaching a pheasant or a hare. Contrary to most indications, it does really seem that we have made a little progress in the last hundred years,�in some directions, at any rate. Les Miserahles was a first-rate film, and if we have taken up an undue amount of space in reviewing it, it is because it just cannot he dis missed in a couple of paragraphs. The same can be said of Ruggles of Red Gap the other Laughton film, which is certainly one of the two or three best pictures that have yet come to the Sylvia Cinema. In this Laughton stars as a comedian, an unusual role far an actor who is ordinarily cast in peculiarly villainous or unpleasant parts (Laughton is rapidly establishing for himself a niche in the cinema industry as the Screen's Swellest Sadist), but one in which his genius is more than ever apparent. He takes the part of Ruggles, the prim English valet, who, while in Paris, is lost at poker by Lord Burnstead, his master, to Egbert Floud (Charles Ruggles), a middle-aged American nouveau riche, and who consequently accompanies Flood and bis socially ambitious wife (Mary Roland) to Red Gap, a primitive settlement somewhere in the State of Washington. There is material in plenty for comedy in this idea, and Laughton and the pro ducers take full advantage of it. The reactions of Laughton, in whom the tradition of service is so deeply ingrained that it has become second nature, to his new and strange environment are both unexpected and diverting. Once again Laughton lived the part. He was the soul and spirit of valetry. the embodiment of suave efficiency and faithful and self-effacing service. He was Jeeves in the flesh; and the scene in which he and Lord Burnstead (Roland Young) bid each other farewell prior to Ruggles� departure for America was per fectly done-a little masterpiece of characteri sation all the more effective for its restraint. Roland Young (Uriah Heap in David Copperfield) is a fine actor, and one to watch. His performance as the charming but eccentric Earl was flawless. Charles Ruggles, who, when well directed, is an asset to any picture, was delightful as the warm hearted parvenu, and Mary Boland, who partners him so successfully, did ample justice, to a parti cularly �fat" part. Maude Eburne was splendidly earthy as the hard-bailed American woman more at home in a bar than in a drawing-room. Zazu Pitts contrived to make Mrs. Judson, Ruggles' faded lady love, completely colourless, but no doubt this was intended. Of the remaining films, Death on the Diamond was a first rate American thriller packed with crooks, racketeers and gamblers, and scintillating with wise-cracks. As the title implies, the story deals with professional baseball, and is concerned with the desperate attempts of an unknown enemy to ruin the star team. We were treated to no less than three murders, and so well were they done that they did not appear excessive or improbable. Paul Kelly was splendid as a hard-boiled newspaper reporter, and stood out. prominently in an excel lent ill-round cast. There is a distinct attraction about these quick-fire American crook play a with their rapid action and their crew of thugs, cops, and sweet young ladies, and this film nearly reached the level of The Thin Man. Good wise-crack : �Say, you�re pretty smart, ain�t ya?� �Oh, no, it ain�t that; it's just that it seems so to people that ain�t as smart as I am." George White's 1935 Scandals was a mediocre musical show which yet succeeded in being rea sonably good entertainment. To a great extent this was due to Ned Sparks, the Man With The Iron Face, whose performance as a Southern barn stormer and small-town mayor was a joy- Eleanor Powell's tap-dancing was little short of miraculous, �oh boy, oh boy, what a figure! What speed! What technique!�And George White as Himself was adequate. He could not go far wrong in this part, at any rate. Sylvia Cinema. PROVISIONAL SCHEDULE OF PROGRAMME Sarawak Library. March, I936. The following books have been added to the Library:� First Division News. FEBRUARY . Sixty-three civil and fifty-eight criminal cases came before the Kuching Courts during February. At an inquest into the death of a Chinese named Chang Niang Choong, who was drowned at Batu Kawa on the 15th February, a verdict of accidental death by drowning was returned. The Assistant District Officer, Mr. G. F. J. Pegler, proceeded to Lundu by m.l. Betty on January 28th and returned to Kuching on February 15th. While in Lundu. he visited villages at Serayan, Sebiris, Sedamak, Sebuku, Paun and Simatan. No matters of any particular importance were brought up for discussion. During the second week of February very heavy seas were running off the coast of Lundu, and m.l. Betty was held up at Kuala Lundu on the return journey to Kuching for four days. 368 persons were treated at Bau Government Dispensary during February, and 118 N.A.B. in jections were given. The Principal Medical Officer visited the station once during the month. The District Officer, Bau, states that the kam pongs round Gunong Serembu were visited according to programme, but there is little of importance to report. It is interesting to note, incidentally, that the Segobang Dayaks set their clocks by the 5 o'clock gun in Kuching, which is some sixteen miles away. The number of applications for gun permits by Land Dayaks is amazing. It shows, however, that there is plenty of money circulating amongst these people. Dahan Rubber Estates harvested 5,000 lbs. of dry rubber during February. There is little doubt that a considerable amount of rubber smuggling is going on in Upper Sarawak, Chinese and Land Dayaks being concerned. While on a border patrol Corporal Ali succeeded in arresting two Chinese and sixteen Dutch Dayaks, who had some seven pikuls of rubber bearing Sarawak stencil numbers which clearly could not have been produced by the stencil holders. One of the Chinese had a letter in his possession signed by the Kapitan China. Png. Tebang, warn ing him to be careful, as the police were rather inquisitive! The case has not yet come up for hearing. Corporal Ali is to be congratulated on an excellent piece of work. The Batu Kitang Road is improving, in spite of the exceptionally bad weather. Kerangan was laid down where necessary, and tailings are also being put down in quantities. The Tondong. S. Ikan, and Jugan roads are impassable. Bidi road is in excellent condition. It is doubtful if the S. Ikan and Jugan roads are Worth keeping up. Mr. K. H. Digby completed his work in con nection with mining syndicates, and returned to Kuching. His report has been submitted. The output of gold for January from Upper Sarawak mines was 1,924.125 ozs. as against 2,133.66 ozs. for December. The following table shows the individual output of gold from the various mines for the month of February : � The District Officer, Serian and Samaharan. reports that an enquiry was held concerning various defamatory statements made in Simunjan by a Malay named Tuanku Raja about the late Court Writer. Lai Ted Fah. The minutes were forwarded to the Resident. On 19th there was an attempted murder at Sebandi, Kuala Samarahan. Mr. Kelly, Assistant Commissioner of Constabulary, arrived and arrested the assailant named Ah Poh, and Lai Khiew, the victim, was taken to Kuching hospital in a critical state, having parting wounds al lover the upper part of his body. Penghulu Giang's cousin applied for permission for himself and four doors of Batang Rejang Dayaks to settle at Temiang, Ulu Simunjan. Permission was granted to Giang's cousin to return to Simunjan. as he originally used to live at Temiang. but the other four doors were refused since immingration of Sea Dayaks from other divisions into the Sadong and Samarahan districts is forbidden. Tuai Rumah Mangki of Ulu Simunjan applied to farm on the true left hand bank of the Gedong. Permission was refused as the Gedong river is the boundary between the Sea Dayaks and Melikins. The District Officer, Serian. states that when he arrived at Kampong Entengan, S. Tuang, Sama rahan, on February 28th the Dayaks were in a great state of excitement as a woman had died at 12 noon the day before, and had come to life again at 4 p.m. She died a second time at 3 a.m. and the body was washed and laid out, and was being carried outside when she again camp to life at 4 a.m. She was still alive, though with very high fever, when the District Officer saw her at 2 p.m. on the 28th. She had some very wonderful stories about the next world, and told bow she had met her grandparents, who would not receive her, and who told her tn return to life. Rhe was given a stimulant, and when the District Officer left her she was still able to walk. The lower Sanmarahan padi is not as good as that in the rest of the district owing to the ravages of bengas. All have been busy gathering the harvest. The Senior Agricultural Officer visited Simunjan on 8th is connection with the demarcation of the T. Bluku. which may later be turned into an experi mental padi farm. A Japanese expert on padi planting arrived at Siniawan during the month, and Messrs. Nissa Shokai & Co. have experimentally planted out various kinds of padi-seeds from Java and Formosa. It is understood that the soil at Samarahan was very well reported on. This year the Japanese have had seven buffaloes working, and the padi is looking good. When finally all tree stumps have been uprooted, the Nissa Shokai padi farm should be an example to the natives. At present there is a shortage of water there, but reservoirs are being made. Work on the new Serian shophouses, which are of standard design, continues, and four new applications for sites have been received. On February 27th news was received from Kuching that two prisoners, Nordin and Jasman, had escaped, and were probably making for Tebe kang and the border. On the name day patrols were sent out from Serian and both prisoners were arrested at Pengkallan Krosen on the 29th and sent back to Kuching under escort. This is the third time that escaped prisoners have been caught on this Pengkallan, the last one being Ex-Sergeant-Major Sulong. It appears that after reaching the 27th mile they cut up to P. Bentang, Munggu Babi. Pichin, and, missing Tebekang, cross the river at Krosen and then go along the main track to the frontier. It ia also a favourite route for both Chinese and Malays who wish to enter Sarawak from Dutch territory without passes, and only a few months ago two Chinese and two Dayaks were arrested while making for Pengkallan Bentang. All shops along the const were examined for over storage of rubber and trading without licences, and at Kampong Pinang, Samarahan, one Chinese was found with an excess of six piculs. The rubber was taken to Nanga Tuang and burnt and a summons issued. In the Endap, one Chinese was found trading without a licence; he is the mandor of Ong Ewe Hai�s Rubber Estate. A summon was issued and the rubber (66 sheets) was confiscated. A report was received that the Nissa Shokai Estate had planted new rubber. I saw the manager on 29th and he said that he gave orders for the jungle to be cleared to enable the coolies to pass from one section of the estate tn another easily, and that while he was away in Kuching for seven days Mr. Hatabe gave orders to the coolies to plant 2,830 new trees. Action will have to be taken against the Estate as the natives are watching eagerly to see if the offence is going to he compounded. Below are extracts from a report by Mr. E. H. Elam, District Officer, Serian and Samarahan, on a visit to Simunjan : - "I visited Simunjan from February 8th to 20th, during which time the Senior Agricultural Officer arrived, and also the Auditor. I left Simunjan on the 21st with the Auditor and spent the night at Semrah, and next day went to Kuching. I returned to Sambir with the Secretary for Native Affairs on the 25th, and then visited every village in the Samarahan and Tilling rivers except Rembus and Embang; in every one the new tuba-fishing Order was explained. The Malays of Tembirat, Bahru and Bondong have built very good kampong roads, a great improvement since my last visit in November. I am not, however, satisfied with Sea and Sebuyow Dayak affairs in the ulu Samarahan, aud have instructed the Native Officer to visit the villages regularly and see if he can settle the district. At present Saribas Dayaks are having their cases tried by a Sebuyow Dayak. A plan for the development of M. Tuang was laid out and forwarded to five Resident, but the whole scheme will fall to the ground if it is found that Haji Jera-ee owns, as he claims, all the land beside the Native Officer�s quarters up the banks of the river. Recent tracings of the area from the Land and Survey Department, however, show a space of forty fathoms of non-alicnatcd land between the edge of Haji Jera-ee�s land and the river bank.

A rugger match was arranged, at very short notice, to take place in Kuching on the evening of Hari Raya Haji, and the response was excellent. The teams which took the field were as follows :� Saleh changed sides at half time from Colours to Whites. Referee.-W. H. Kelley. The game started at a very fast pace which, as might be expected, was not maintained in the second half. Colours missed many opportunities of scoring in the first half when they were getting the ball out from almost every scrum, but managed to score three unconverted tries. One of these tries was scored by Saleh with a very clever run ending between the posts. Saleh showed himself throughout the game to be a very promising player, and his swerve would be the envy of many first-class players at home. In the second half Stephen Harry, playing wing three-quarter, broke away and ran strongly to score Whites� only try. We hope that many more Malays will he encouraged to play with us in the future. Noakes again showed us all how rugger should be played, and was the outstanding player throughout the game. Griffin, for Colours, ran very strongly on the wing and was always dangerous. The tackling was very disappointing when com pared with the game played at the end of December. Possibly the hesitation in "going low" was due to the fact that bools were worn and not gym shoes, as before. Our thanks are due to Mr. W. H. Kelley for lending the Police Ground for the game, and also for filling the post of referee. He coined out this duty really well and, by overlooking small faults due to inexperience or lack of practice, kept the game going with a minimum of stoppages. There were no free kicks awarded to either side. The game, which was played for rather more than ten minutes each way, resulted in a win for Colours by 9 points to 3, and was so enjoyable that it is hoped that a few more practices may be arranged before Race Week, when possibly two teams of fifteen may be raised. The third rugger match of the season took place on Saturday, 14th March, at the Police Padang, Badrudin Road. Heavy rain during the afternoon had reduced the pitch to a quagmire, and combined back play was al a discount. It was an ideal day for the rushing tearaway type of forward, who however, is mainly conspicuous in Kuching by his absence. Great keenness was shewn by the Malays in this match and no less than fifteen Asiatics turned out, enabling the sides to take the field at full strength. Our thanks are due to all those who showed keen ness enough to turn out, and we hope enthusiasm for the game will wax and not wane as time goes on. As a matter of fact, it is somewhat doubtful whether it is wise at the moment to include at the same time so many men who are strange to the game. The real rugger man who knows the game, and whose example might with advantage be followed by the beginner, is apt to be swamped in the keen but unskilful rushings and jostlings of the newcomers. Sides of five forwards and three three quarters might prove better as a medium of instruc tion for those new to the Rugby code. Of the game itself little need be said. It was not a game of outstanding incidents, honest endeavour was too often baulked by a sodden ground or a slippery ball, or even, as one member of the Colours XV found to his cost and probably to his great surprise, by a determined and tenacious tackle by a member of his own side. Whites won three minutes from time, Whale scoring the only try of the match. Of the backs Henson for the Colours and Griffin for the Whites both shewed good form, but the defence was generally on top. Durrant placed a determined game ut forward for the winners and both packs stuck to their work well. W. J. Chater shewed keenness for the Colours and seemed in better training than most. Mr. A. G. Taylor very ably led the Colours� scrum. The complete lack of knowledge of the off-side rule shewn by most of the forwards, and the dis covery now arid then of a wing three-quarter in the midst of a set scrum, only added to the gaiety of things, and one must congratulate Mr. Kitto, the referee, for his tactful and altogether satisfactory handling of the game. The afternoon closed with a demonstration by the crowd in the stand who. unlike most of the players, seemed to consider that the second half was unduly short. A claim for the return of gate-money, how ever, was firmly refused.�Contributed. Club News. Sarawak Club. HANDICAP BOWLS COMPETITION: February, 1936. Tennis. Mixed Doubles Championship Final.�Mrs. Pitt Hardacre and Mitchell beat Mrs. Kelley and Kitto 6-4, 6-1. The first set was very even, but in the second set, Mitchell, who was serving and volleying really well, carried all before him. Mrs. Pitt-Hardacre also played a very sure game, making very few mistakes. Don�t be downhearted Mrs. Kelley! Next time perhaps you will have a partner who docs not "poach" so much. Now that the long-drawn-out season has come to au end. we should like to compliment all the mems on their vastly improved play. Mrs. Calvert, for example, is now placing at least +30 bettor than she was six months ago. A thing the meins should attempt, though, is to go up to the nct and indulge in a little volleying. All that is needed is courage, and then they will find the game much more enjoyable. To begin with, just go and stand about four feet behind the net when your partner is serving. The stroke required can be learnt in the privacy of one�s home and only three things are required: a small frying pan, a chair and your husband. Having obtained there three essentials, order your husband to sit on the chair and then stand in front of him about lour feet away. Hold the frying pan nearly vertical by grasping the handle with one hand, and assume a slightly crouching position as though about to spring forward. Resist this temptation, however, and merely push the frying pan smartly into his face. Now, when executing the push volley at tennis, you go through exactly the same action. What could be simpler? Just try it and see. Also remember that the psychological effect of a mem smiling over the net is enough to put most poor susceptible bachelors off their game straight away. �(Contributed.) Kuching Badminton Association. The Kuching Badminton Association has been formed as from the 1st day of March, 1936, with its headquarters and official address at Haji Taha Road, Kuching. His Highness the Rajah has very kindly consented to become Patron of the Association. The office-bearers for the current year 1936/1937 :- The Association has been formed for the purpose of holding Annual Badminton Championships and to improve the standard of badminton. It is intended to hold an open tournament, both for men and women, Rome lime in May this year. Full particulars will be rent to all clubs at an early date. Badminton parties or clubs may affiliate with the K.B.A. by paying a yearly affiliation fee of $3. Badminton is a game which is already very popular in Kuching, but we think the time has now come to co-ordinate the activities of the various small clubs by the formation of the Kuching Badminton Association. A programme of friendly games is being arranged and. to start off with, the Sarawak Club and the Chinese Clubs are inviting members of some of the Malay kampong clubs to their courts. We hope to make these friendly games one of the chief objects of the Association. The Hon.

(دترجمه اوليه م. ن. ه.) Second Division News. FEBRUARY. On February 3rd, four Spak Dayaks were sentenced in the Resident�s Court, Simanggang, to six months� rigorous imprisonment for harbouring Kayan and Jeluieng, two outlaws who arc wanted for murder. An inquest was held by Native Officer Abang Morni on Taw anak Adeng, of Rumah Kula, Banting, who was drowned at Stogo, Lingga, on February 7th. A verdict of suicide during tempo rary insanity caused by excessive indulgence in alcohol was returned. Two hundred and thirty-eight out-patients were treated at Simanggang Government Dispensary during the month, and 189 N.A.B. injections were administered. On the 13th, six Dayaks from the Skrang obtained passes to move to Temburong, in Brunei territory. They were the advance guard of the main party of nine doors. On the 12th, Tuai Rumah Sait reported that the preliminary clearing of the experimental demon stration vegetable garden at ?nteban had been completed. A temporary building had also been erected. A Chinese vegetable gardener was sent to Entebau with an Inspector from the Agricultural Department to prepare seed-beds, etc. Seeds and cuttings will be sent up early in March. Harvesting is in progress in most parts of the Simunggang district, and good crops are reported, except from Dan and certain areas of the Sebuyow, where rats and empangau have earned some damage. Harvesting has been completed in the Ulu Lingga and the Ulu Sebuyow, where very heavy crops are reported. On the 12th, Tuai Rumah Grang, of Nanga Matu, Ulu Lemanak, reported that his house of eleven doors had been totally destroyed by fire. Apparently the fire was accidentally caused by a woman named Seda. Padi crops in the Engkilili district appear to be excellent, much to the relief of the natives, who have undergone considerable hardship as a result of the failure of the harvest last year. On February 3rd, a prisoner named Ginda escaped from Engkilili Jail while his fellow-prisoners were preparing their morning meal. He was met at Pungkang by his mother, who sent him back to prison during the afternoon. On February 27th. Ts'ai Nyat Ted was elected Capitan China of Engkilili following a meeting hold in the Court. House and attended by nearly all the towkays of the station. Two hundred and twenty-three out-patients were treated at Betong Government Dispensary during the month, and ninety-two N.A.B. injections were administered. The general health of the district was good. Towards the end of the month three Tuai Rumah proceeded to Kuching to interview His Highness the Rajah and to plead for a remission of sentence for the Spak Tuai Rumah who were sentenced at Simanggang to six months� imprisonment for har bouring outlaws. Alternate heavy showers and bright sunshine have encouraged fanners to look forward to a good harvest in the Saribas district. Harvesting of swamp padi has started in the Pusa and Debak districts; Belong, where planting was not seriously begun until November, has less favourable pros pects. Reports on hill padi continue to be very satisfactory. Towards the end of the month, thirty-five Dayaks under Chendang, of Rumah Penghuhi Ramba, Nanga Mujan, and Dabong, of Rumah Saran Tarum Buai, Engkari, started for Nanga Kanowit to work for Air. Kidd on Tanah Estate, Ltd. They all went overland, the Batang Ai party by way of Ulu Lelap arid Lumut, and the Engkari by the Lanja, and so down the Kanowit. It was agreed that whichever party arrived first would wait the other at Nanga Meluan. A claim against Bungkong (Tuai Rumah of Lobang Baya) for kandong was made by one of his own anakbiak during the month. Since the actual kandong occurred some six or seven years ago during Bungkong's absence in Perak. and since no claim has been made until now, it is generally considered that the girl and her supporters will have their work cut out to carry the matter through, especially as the girl's parents made the mistake of killing the lenian Mure making the claim. The whole case was brought up out of spite caused by dis satisfaction nt the distribution made by Bungkong of his reward for the capture of Bala and Bidat, the Song murderers, last year. Ulu Dayaks are now busy harvesting. and a start has been made in the Lubok Antu neighbourhood. The padi crop in general is good this year, though the peoplc living between Nanga Engkari and Nanga Delok are again in for a bad time. Reports from the Delok are not very good. The District Officer, Lubok Antu, submits the following report on a trip up river in search of Dayak outlaws :- "On February 6th, I sent N.O. Abang Abu Talip and twelve constables oil up river, and started myself the next day. By making use of the outboard (which unexpectedly did not break down) as far as Krangan Mong, I reached Nanga Musing the first day, and Rumah Abong at Krangan Tibu (Nanga Lobang Baya) on the next. The following day I went up to Nanga Mujan, and engaged three Dayaks as guides for the Ulu Ai patrol. I put Abang Abu Talip in charge of the Mujan, and ordered L.-C. Mawar at Nanga Tiga to patrol the Gaong, Menamong, Supa and Sungei Barik, and to watch the road from the Dutch Border. 1 myself took on the Ulu Batang Ai, and made my chief langkau at Lempa, but soon moved on to a spot between N. Teliang and N. Kaup from where it was easy to watch the border. There were no signs of the outlaws, nor of the Dutch troops on the border, though the latter had started about a fortnight before I had. I returned to Lubok Antu on 25th but left Abang to do a final round of the Ulu Ai. The land in the Ulu Ai is excellent for padi, or any other crops. The river above the Lempa has no wong or grugu; there are quite large pieces of empran, and the hills are only gently sloping, very different indeed from the Batang Ai country lower down. The land was formerly farmed by the ancient 'Ulu Ai' of whose descendants (so I am told) there are none left in this river, but it appears that the Baleh, Gat and some of the Katibas people are descended from them. Third Division News. FEBRUARY. Thirty-three civil and fifty-two criminal cases came before the Sibu Courts during the month. Requests from Chinese to open small vegetable gardens in the temuda in compartment 3 of Bukit Lima Forest reserve were taken advantage of, and two small taungya plots were laid out adjoining the original experimental plot planted in 1932. Each plot is about one acre in area, and will be treated in the same manner as the original plot. On February 27th the Divisional Forest Officer left for Kapit in M.L. Chamois with the District Officer, Kapit, to continue, and if possible complete, the boundary survey of the Pelagus reserve. Work on the foundations of the New Sibu Hospital continued. By the end of the month 618 bakan 26' piles had been driven into position. On February 5th a quantity of decomposed fish was found exposed for sale in Sibu fish market. This was seized and destroyed, and those responsible were warned that should this happen again, they will be prosecuted. The Chief Justice and the Principal Medical Officer arrived at Sibu in H.H.M.Y. Maimuna on February 18th. The Chief Justice proceeded the same day to the Fourth Division, and called at Sibu on the 26th on his return to Kuching. The Principal Medical Officer returned to Kuching on the 20th. At the beginning of the month the bazaar was crowded with levies from the blockhouses in the Kanowit area, who were being paid off since the garrisons of these blockhouses are being disbanded Several meetings of the Sibu Rent Restriction Committee were held during the month to examine the question of increased rents claimed by landlords on the grounds of increased prosperity. After due consideration it was agreed that in certain cases rents should be raised. An appeal to the Supreme Court from the Resi dent's Court case in which Chop Yong Kee, of Binatang, was convicted of smuggling matches, was heard by the Chief Justice at Sarikei. The judg ment of the Resident�s Court was upheld, but the sentence was reduced to a fine of $1,000. At Matu a well-to-do Haji was fined $250 for illicit planting of rubber. During February one inquest was held nt Binatang on the body of a Chinese cooly working for one of the sago factories, who was found hanging from a beam in the factory cooly-lines. A verdict of suicide was returned. At Matu a Foochow was drowned when he slipped off the bridge over the river opposite the Kubu in the early hours of the morning. Rescue work was apparently delayed, and further enquiries are being instituted by the Officer-in-Charge. Matu. Except for one case of breach of trust, there was no serious crime in the Lower Rejang district during the month. The Principal Medical Officer and the Government Dentist paid a short visit to Sarikei on February 18th. The District Officer, Lower Rejang, reports that large numbers of Dayaks continue to come to buy cartridges. A wandering Kampar Dayak was brought in by some Julau Dayaks, as he could give no satisfactory account of himself. He was duly sent up to Sibu. The Dayaks are to he commended for this action as it is proof their desire to assist Government in rounding up the outlaws. It is anticipated that the recent drought will have seriously affected the chances of a good padi crop in the bills of the Lower Rejang District, but as yet there have been no reports to this effect Seeds were received from Kuching and an experimental vegetable garden is now laid out and planted clone to the Sarikei office, It is hoped that the first crop of vegetables will be ready for con sumption in about six week's time. Work on the Sarikei wharf was finished early in the month, and the wharf was once again opened to vessels of all sizes on February 10th. Mooring facilities are still inadequate, and the long breast hawsers attached to the shore bollards, together with the spring ropes. are continually breaking and giving trouble. The Binatang godown is nearing completion. Contracts for earth filling to the floor and for making paths to the godown are in hand. Abang Openg. Native Officer, visited the Dayaks in the ulu Sarikei on February 8th and 9th. Abang Otton. Native Officer of Binatang. toured the Dayaks in the District of the new Penghulu Kana, who has taken over a share of Penghulu Ikan's district below Leba�an, from Ilie 1st to 13th. Police and village constables were on tour through out the whole district during the Tapping Holiday. Schooner Soon Ann of 54 tons called in at Matu on the 18th and cleared on the 21sL This is the first large schooner to enter the river since 1933. As a contrast to last month, the weather on the coast was particularly mild. The District Officer, Lower Rejang, spent a whole day and night at Tanjong Sirik examining the area which it is necessary to clear round the light-house. The land has made tremendous at this point; in 1923 the light-house used to be on the verge of the sea, but it is now about a mile inland on the western side, and two-thuds of a mile inland on the northern side. The tapping holiday again proved a success, since there was only one small ease of illegal tapping in the whole Lower Rejang District. This occurred at Matu, where a Melanau gave as his excuse that he had misunderstood the dale. A small fine was imposed. Relief work was given to mine indigent Chinese coolies during the holiday. They were employed on, making u path through the gardens from the Nyelong river at Sarikei towards Binatang. A distance of some 3 1/2 miles was covered, and quite a good path now exends almost as far as Sungei Selidap. This is a very useful piece of work, as the path follows the telephone rentis and will thus considerably decrease the cost of upkeep of this rentis, while it is also on the direct line to Binatang. Street lighting was supplied in Binatang from the first of the month by the Sarawak Electricity Supply Company. A number of shophouses have also had electno light installed. The light is not very good, owing to the low power of the engine in the plant, but the benefit is considerable in a station which pre viously boasted no street lamps at all. Government quarters have been wired up. but contact points have not yet been installed. At Matu Her Highness the Ranee's birthday was celebrated by the opening of the "Abang Subah" school, a new Malay School in Kampong Bawang. Attendances promise to be good and the school should proven a success. Only two criminal cases came before the Kapit courts during the month, both cases of petty theft involving the same accused; sentences totalling six months were imposed. No civil cases were heard during the month, and no serious crime came to light. The District Officer, Kapit, reports than on February 17th Abang Indeh, Native Officer, returned from Woh Padang and ulu Katibas having patrolled the area farmed by the outlaws and destroyed everything be could find. No news has yet been heard of Penghulu Grinang's expedition up the ulu Gat. Propaganda work is still being carried out in Kapit district regarding the approaching prohibition of tuba fishing; unfortunately dissatisfaction is still felt in some places, but every effort will be made to remove this feeling. Most of the Dayaks realize that prohibition has to come. Harvesting is now in full swing. Although crops are good in Some districts, the general harvest is only moderate. The Katibas padi is reported to have suffered very severely from rats and birds. Four hundred and thirty-seven logs were rafted to Sibu by Chop Lee Hua during February. Twenty one logs remained at Kapit at the end of the month. The District Officer, Oya and Dalat, reports that all has been quiet in the Ulu. Dayaks have been busy on their farms. Reports on the padi crop during the month have not been so good as previously. A good harvest is hoped for, but rats, pigs and empanngau have been causing considerable damage. The weather on the coast has generally speaking been fine, and fishing has been in full swing, but the catches have not been good. The price of raw sago increased slightly on the figures for Iast month, the price per passu at Dalat being 50 cents, and at the Kut 55 cents. The amount of raw sago exported from the Oya District increased slightly as compared with last month, the figures being :- In collaboration with the District Officer, Mukah, the Penat-Judan road was inspected and also the bridges across these two rivers on February 11th. The Penat bridge is undergoing repairs, and the road from Penat to Judan has been re-made further inland away from the sea and running in a straight line beside the telephone poles. Permission was received by the Committee of the Chin Hua School, Dalat, to collect subscriptions up to $1,000 for the completion of the school. Work on the school is in progress and subscriptions arc coming in. Police patrols visited every part of the Oya District throughout the tapping holiday, and no cases of illicit tapping were brought to light. On February 10th, two Village Constables were stationed half way between Kampong Kekan and Kampong Kut to count the number of boats which traversed the Kut during twenty-four hours. It was found that sixty boats laden with sago proceeded from Dalat to Kampong Kut, and that thirty-one boats laden with various merchandise proceeded from Kampong Kut to Dalat. The water in the Kut was very low on this occasion, but in spite of this the volume of traffic indicates that this channel of communication is of great importance to the district. The District Officer, Mukah, reports that no further action has been taken in the Judan robbery case, though inquiries as to where the stolen goods were disposed of are still proceeding. Local searchers have revealed nothing. No other crime was reported in the Mukah district during the month. It has been decided to hold a monthly meeting of all Tua-tua kampong in order to discuss current affairs, principally land and sago. Efforts have been made to induce sorne natives to ship sago to the Kut where they obtain a much better price for their product, but they seem strangely unwilling to escape from the clutches of local money-lenders. A notice was posted at Mukah reminding the native population of the previsions of Order No. 24 of 1915 which states that all Likos who adopt the Mohammedan faith should make a will, or a deed, for the protection of their children, who, in accor dance with the Mohammedan uudang undang, stand to lose all their inheritance in these cases. Thirty-two vessels totalling 1,067 tons cleared from Mukah during February. Island Club Grand National Sweepstake 1936. THE DRAW. Fourth Division News. FEBRUARY. In the Resident�s Court at Miri two Sibuti Chinese were lined $300 each for an impudent attempt to obtain money by falsifying their books. This case arose out of an appeal from a decision in the Miri Court of Small causes. During the hearing of this appeal (which was upheld) the fraud was discovered. One of the Sarawak Oilfields, Ltd., clerks was sentenced at Miri to two terms of imprisonment of 18 months each for breach of trust and falsification of books. The Resident, Fourth Division, left Miri on Feb ruary 18th for a tour in the old Fifth Division, returning on the 28th. During the course of this tour he visited Limbang, Lawas, Trusan, Sundar, Brooketon. Brunei and Labuan. Nothing of much importance was brought forward except the difficulty of keeping up Government roads, grounds and buildings on the reduced votes. Limbang Bazaar appeared to be flourishing and full of people and goods, and Lawas Bazaar has built a substantial school. Lawas and Limbang rubber estates are doing well. The District Officer, Limbang and Lawas. reports that Court work was exceedingly light during the month, and no crime of any importance was reported or detected in his district. Very few Dayaks or up-river natives visited Limbang during February, being all busy with their padi-harvests. Reaping was in full swing in both hill and swamp land by the end of the month. The pepper crop was ripening by the end of February and appeared satisfactory, hut it is yet too early to predict the quantity that will be collected. The tapping holiday was conscientiously observed throughout the Limbang district, and only one breach of regulations was detected. This was com mitted by a Tua Kampong who should have known better, and who was consequently severely dealt with. Except for a small quantity from Limbang Estate, no rubber was exported from Limbang during the last two weeks of the month. The carpentcr, some prisoners, and the crew of the launch were busy for about two weeks on the thorough overhaul, repairs aud repainting of m.l. Sylvia. M.L. .Sylvia was put on the slipway for this period. The top main dam at Bukit Hitam, Limbang, ran dry during the month, so advantage was taken of this to clean it out. The lower dam was utilized; this contains excellent water, but has not sufficient gravity to give much pressure. Advantage was taken of the dry weather to patch up some of the worst places on the Panderuan and Berawan roads. Mr. J. R. Outram, Cadet, accompanied by up river Agent Jaya, and Penghulu Wee, left on Feb ruary 4th on a visit to all houses in the Panderuan and Berawan. returning to Limbang on 9th. A drought was experienced throughout the month at Limbang. a total of only 2.53 inches of rain being recorded. This was made up of small showers at night, and these only occurred on six occasions. Penghulu Manggoi of the Niah came down to Miri during the month and reported all well in his district. T.K. Pejaweng (Penan) of Ulu Niah reported that his house had been burnt down while he was away working damar. T.K. Sugon (Penan) of S. Sawai, Ulu Suai, reported an inferior crop of Penan padi this season. Pests include ulat and belalang, kera and rats. Alterations are continuing to the new Gambling Farm premises at Miri, aud it is hoped to open this building in the near future. Mr. D. V. Murphy, Assistant Commissioner, Sarawak Constabulary, relieved Mr. W. L. P. Sochon, Officer Commanding Miri Constabulary Sector, on the latter's transfer to Sibu. H.H.M.Y. Maimuna arrived at Miri from Lim bang during the month and was reported to have damaged plates in her bottom. An inspection was made and the vessel was able to continue her journey to Kuching. The District Officer, Miri, paid a routine visit to Niah and Sibuti districts from the 10th to 15th, when all books and cash were checked and outstand ing matters settled. Almost continual rain is reported from Sibuti, but Miri district as a whole enjoyed a spell of fair weather during February, rain being noticeable by its absence. The Assistant District Officer, Lawas and Trusan, reports that all natives are away on their farms. The padi crops in the Lawas and Merapok rivers are reported to be good, but those in Trusan have suffered a good deal from pests. The Lawas (Sarawak) Estates, Limited, exported 36,260 lbs dry rubber during the month. The number of pupils attending the Chung Hua School, Lawas, is now 34. They come from Trusan, Sundar, and Merapok, as well ns from Lawas. During the month two deaths, and one severe injury that may prove fatal, were caused by crocodiles at Baram. The actual facts are as yet uncertain as investigations are still in progress, but from the rather vague reports it appears that a Kenyah from Loug Ikan was taken whilst fishing in a small lake above the Tutoh, and an Iban whilst fishing in the Bakong. The remains of both bodies were recovered. A Kayan from Long Laput, also fishing in a small tributary of the Tru, was attacked, and a large part of his thigh removed. All three cases are being inquired into. Several parties of Kelabits have been down to Baram lately, selling tobacco, and asking assistance in auctioning rhinoceros horns. Their country has not been visited by a European officer for nearly four years, and it is unfortunate that the proposed trip next month has had to be cancelled. N.O. Mohamad Zin Galau, however, will start by way of the Apoh on the 10th, and it is hoped that, a European will he able to go. either towards the end of this year, or at the beginning of next. Galau has instructions to obtain the opinion of the various headmen concerning the proper person to replace the late Penghulu Tanma Abu Tingang. Mr. D. C. Hudden, District Officer, Barnin, sub mits the following report on a trip to the Ulu :� Accompanied by Native Officers Tuanku Mohamad and Galau I left Mairudi on January 17th to attend the three Penan meetings at Long Melinau. Long Akah and Lio Matu. The attendance at each place was poor, for the reason, it is felt, that a certain amount of surreptitious trading is still occurring. It would tend to assist matters if the same regulations for Penans were adopted in the Balui and Belaga as in this district. The inhabitants of the Tinjar, especially, are continually inquiring the reason that they themeelves are enforced to trade in the presence of a Government representative, whilst on the other side of the watershed, two days� walk al the most, there are no restrictions. "Galau was left at Long Linai on the 23rd, returning to Marudi on the 27th, and Tuanku Mohamad and myself proceeded up the Baram. At Long Lama several of the birdsnests� caves were inspected, and it was found that the mouths of all caves had been cleared of timber and brush wood for some considerable distance. The originator of this senseless innovation is of course unknown, but like sheep everyone has followed his example. The birds have gone deeper into the caves, to avoid the light and heat, and have buit in more inaccessible places, where they arc more likely to he preyed upon by bats. "At Long Akah Aban Wan handed in his flag and Aban Jau has agreed to assist by acting in his place, for the month or two that will be necessary before his successor is appointed. "Tuanku Mohamad left me on February 14th al Long Pawan, and returned to Marudi down the Baram. 1 walked across to the Tinjar. where Tuanku Taha was awaiting at Long Salai. Having visited all houses in the Tinjar we returned to Marudi on the 28th. "The journey took twelve days longer than was expected, portly owing to high water whilst going up the Baram; with an outboard motor it could have been done in half the time." The natives in the Baram District are now harvesting their crops but reports are not encourag ing. At the best, there will he just sufficient to last until next year. Even where crops were good, and normally there would have been a satisfactory harvest, half has been destroyed by rate and juice, and the usual insects. The number of rats has been phenomenal and unprecedented. The Rev. Father Feltbrugge paid a visit to Baram during the month. During his stay he visited the Dayaks in the Bakung, and returned direct to Miri. Work on the stumping of the Bintulu landing ground has made very satisfactory progress. It was always realised that this was an unknown quantity, but it is proving much more difficult than was originally thought, and work is retarded by the absence of any kind of stumping machinery. During February, an area of about thirty acres was practically clean-stumped, and removal of the stumps from the actual landing area was started. A detailed survey of the swampy area was earned out by Ah Poon. Overseer of the Public Works Department. Mr. D. L. Leach of the Survey Department was in the Bintulu iffilrict on and off throughout the month in connection with the trig. survey. I am told that Bukits Skalap, Bala, Nyabau and Sap have been cleared ready for the erection of trig. stations. The Sarawak Timber and Trading Company's campaign for logs has proved rather too much for their production capacity. The District officer. Bintulu. says that he saw ready in the Pandan abont 1,800 logs, and over 3,000 have already been received at the mill. This represents nearly one years requirements, and there is some anxiety whether these logs will not be ruined by pin-worm before they can be used. This is in contrast to last year, when the mill had frequently to be stopped on account of shortage of logs. CORRESPONDENCE [The Editor is not responsible for the opinions of correspondents.] BISHOP'S HOUSE, KUCHING, SARAWAK, 9th March, 1936. To 'The Editor of the . SIR, I have to-day read in the Gazette the extract you have printed from the November number of the Borneo Chronicle under the heading of "Sold Into Slavery,� together with your comments thereon. Obviously, at such a distance�the Chronicle is published in England�I am not in a position to "edit� any matter other than that which is supplied from the diocese itself. The extract quoted is not mutter written by anyone at present working in Sarawak. However, I cannot but feel a responsibility, and I wish therefore, to hasten to express my deep regret that such statements should have been made by the writer of the extract in question. To take some comfort in observing, after a careful reading of the extract, that the writer is in fact referring to Chinese in general, and not specifically to the Chinese in Borneo. I am, indeed, certain that the writer, whatever inference may be drawn, did not wilfully inlend to give the impression, suggested by your third headline. The fact remains, however, that the last sentence quoted carries with it a more than unfortunate insinuation, that what may�I do not know�be true of certain parts of China, is true of the Chinese in Borneo. I can only repent my regret, and place on record, if I may, my conviction that the Government authorities would never for a moment knowingly countenance such habits. 1 beg to remain.
